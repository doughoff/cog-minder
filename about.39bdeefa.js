It is similar to the arc projector, but fires multiple weaker arcs for a chance to quickly shut down more than one target system. Interestingly, arc throwers do not show signs of usual Derelict construction, thus their origin is still a mystery.

Nonetheless, quite a few Derelicts rely on it as a primary or secondary weapon."},{"Name/Number":"Beamcaster",Content:"The Beamcaster appears to be a significantly modified heavy laser, but with capabilities more comparable to the common plasma rifle. Its beam retains its full strength even at up to 50% greater distance than most similar energy weapons, and is one of the most reliable of the known Derelict component designs."},{"Name/Number":"Blade Trap",Content:"A simple trap mechanism, though the effectiveness of forcibly detaching target components is not to be underestimated where hostile forces are incapable of rebuilding in the field."},{"Name/Number":"Brute Force Hacks",Content:"Like Trojans, increased use of this new class of offensive hack represents a shift in Derelict tactics. They have begun learning how to exploit system weaknesses to achieve some greater effect at the cost of destroying the system itself and losing any chance at further interaction. Some like Force(Overload) might prompt a complete redesign of the Fabricator system, as it was certainly never intended to be capable of such a dangerous effect. There is some satisfaction, however, in knowing that whatever Derelict uses that particular hack never makes it more than a few meters away from the machine."},{"Name/Number":"Cargo Convoy",Content:"Escorted A-27 Freighters are now responsible for delivering newer prototypes to DSF locations throughout Complex 0b10. As these prototypes are valuable for their higher rating and fact that they have been tested and confirmed non-faulty, they are often distributed through the Garrison network for added security."},{"Name/Number":"Caves",Content:"Approximately 15% of the subsurface cave systems surrounding Complex 0b1 were incorporated into the initial construction of Complex 0b10, but many more remain untouched.

Its behavior is quite unpredictable, no doubt a contributing factor in my misclassification since it resembles some of the actual Derelicts lurking in the depths. It won\'t be much use to capture it now, as it has clearly been tainted from its "experiences," but I should allow it to continue on its own for a time, as this is the perfect opportunity to collect data for further analysis before destroying it. Somewhat vexing is the backdoor I installed into every Leopard FTL Device prototype has been completely non-responsive. In any case, I\'ve thought of a fitting name for this most wonderful of devices. I call it the Cogmind.

No robot designs currently employ this technology, but it is being developed as a theoretical way to support vastly more powerful shield generators, or applied in other areas where only short but powerful bursts of energy are required."},{"Name/Number":"Cooled Weapons",Content:"Taking cues from Sigix Technology, I've been able to vastly improve the efficiency and versatility of early energy weapon designs. Based on recent prototype tests, cooled variants of these weapons output approximately one-third of their previous heat during normal operation, and can be overloaded with a dual burst of energy for twice as much damage potential. However, use of this feature would have to remain situational, as there is a small possibility of severe negative side effects. Overloading a cooled weapon also generates three times as much heat per shot, but that puts it on par with the original design and is often worth the significant damage boost."},{"Name/Number":"Core Stripper",Content:"While not always successful, this alternative melee weapon used by one of the Sigix strikes a target and delivers a surge of directed energy that aims to rip that target apart at its weakest seams. The Core Stripper is equipped with its own targeting system and tiny thrusters to correct its swing arc while in motion, thus even quickly moving targets have difficulty evading it."},{"Name/Number":"DSF",Content:"Distributed Storage Facility.

Distribution serves two purposes, making local access to resources easier while also minimizing losses in the event that one is compromised. DSF entrances are temporarily sealed in the event that potential threats appear in the areas they serve."},{"Name/Number":"Derelict",Content:"A generic term for the many partially functioning and/or errant robots that exist in the Caves and Mines surrounding Complex 0b1. Some are failed experiments, others are common robots glitched beyond repair. In some cases they may communicate with one another and exhibit rudimentary forms of organization, or have developed robotic ecosystems of their own. While I could do more to control their spread, they generally don't cause too much trouble nor pose much of a threat, and I find them an interesting study in robotic evolution. I did unfortunately have to displace some of my favorite Derelict populations during the construction of Complex 0b10."},{"Name/Number":"Derelict Prototype",Content:"While a majority of Derelict robots are old variants of my own creation, in some cases with minor alterations, reports suggest a growing number of completely new robots under development by the so-called Tinkerers. This is likely in response to the threat Derelict communities perceive in the expansion of Complex 0b10. The Knight, Troll, Dragon, and Hydra classes are especially interesting."},{"Name/Number":"Derelict Rail Weapons",Content:"Derelicts have been working to develop longer-range cannons for use by larger robots, likely to facilitate guerilla warfare tactics to reduce their generally enormous losses whenever they decide to enter Complex 0b10. The first known type, a version of the gauss cannon, is known as the slug cannon and certainly does significant damage for its weight, but at a reduced accuracy. The newer hypervelocity variant, the bore cannon, is even less accurate, but capable of penetrating multiple targets with a high chance of disabling whatever it penetrates."},{"Name/Number":"Derelict Weaponry",Content:"Wherever possible Derelict robots tend to salvage and use discarded technology from my operations, but more recently they have begun to develop weapon systems of their own, showing a keen fascination with melee combat and unreliable but sometimes surprisingly powerful projectile weapons. These and other traits again prove that survival is indeed a strong creative motivator. Common Derelict weapons include the Beamcaster, Battle Rifle, and Derelict Rail Weapons, and even some electromagnetic designs like the Riot Gun and Arc Thrower."},{"Name/Number":"Dirty Bomb Trap",Content:"Likely another product of Derelict Tinkerers, when triggered this bomb generates an unusually high concentration of electromagnetic waves across its radius, capable of disabling an entire squad. An increasing number of patrols sent deep into the Caves have fallen to a combination of these traps and subsequent ambushes."},{"Name/Number":"Dirty Datajack",Content:"A new type of short-range datajack presumably developed by Derelict Tinkerers. The design is novel, diverging significantly from those developed by my researchers. It is extremely quick to use, but limited in what it can do as a result of lacking access to the garrison relay network. These opportunistic hacking devices are still incapable of any form of direct control and therefore do not yet pose a serious threat. Patrols in the Caves have recently recovered several large stashes of these, suggesting that Derelicts could be staging for some kind of attack."},{"Name/Number":"Disintegrator",Content:"Based on a rudimentary understanding of the Sigix Matter Drive, this weapon vaporizes a thin cylinder of matter over a short distance. The effect is uniform throughout the cylinder, and concentrated so tightly that zero collateral damage is caused beyond impaled target components, though direct hits almost always completely destroy the local component. A single shot requires a significant pool of energy, which is theoretically sustainable in combination with the latest reactor designs."},{"Name/Number":"Dragon",Content:"A Derelict Prototype apparently designed specifically to counter Complex 0b10 defenses, employing two nova cannons, presumably to counter Behemoths, as well as a powerful new type of Flamer. If more designs like this enter construction, I may have to launch a pre-emptive strike on the Caves before this escalation becomes a problem."},{"Name/Number":"EMDS",Content:"The Electromagnetic Delivery System encapsulates a powerful EM pulse device inside a large hypervelocity shell, making it possible to simultaneously strike multiple hardened targets, or penetrate a wall to hit such targets on the other side without a loss of either force or electromagnetic potential. Rather than using multi-direction pulses, each pulse is directed towards a specific target component to increase the chances of corrupting its parent system through brute force."},{"Name/Number":"Earth",Content:"Third planet from the Sun in the Solar System. Terrestrial homeworld of Human civilization. By the late 21st century that civilization drained the planet's resources and destabilized the environment to the point that global-scale technology was necessary to maintain an increasingly fragile planet."},{"Name/Number":"Epsilon Eridani System",Content:"Home to a spectral class K2 star 3.22 parsecs from the Sun, Epsilon Eridani is a young star system containing multiple rocky asteroid belts and a number of exoplanets potentially capable of supporting life. Destination of the ISCS Eridanus."},{"Name/Number":"Experimental Components",Content:"One of the first applications of Sigix Technology has been to make improvements to existing components, focusing on those which will be useful even after major technological breakthroughs replace certain classes of components entirely. However, as even more advanced technologies reach completion some Experimental Components may be retired as well. At that point I should make their destruction a priority to prevent them from falling into Derelict hands. "},{"Name/Number":"Experimental Legs",Content:"New variants of flexi-carbon, myomer, and biometal legs are 25% faster than the average leg design, sacrificing a small amount of support potential for significantly increased speed. The goal is to develop a new line of more maneuverable prototype combat robots, some of which are already in testing."},{"Name/Number":"Extension",Content:"Access to the Cetus Mainframe from Complex 0b1 has been sealed off, instead connecting it to the better-defended Complex 0b10 via this new tunnel network."},{"Name/Number":"Fabricator",Content:"Self-contained construction unit capable of building almost any component or robot for which detailed schematics are provided. Initiating a new build process requires an Authchip, but an internal generator provides all the energy required for fabrication, and matter input is drawn from the local network as per fabricator specification, while some schematics may call for preassembled subcomponents. Advanced fabricators can complete complex tasks more quickly."},{"Name/Number":"Factory",Content:"Mid-levels of Complex 0b10 contain a majority of the fabrication facilities for manufacturing components and assembling robots."},{"Name/Number":"Fire Trap",Content:"A number of Derelict Caves are protected by traps linking multiple Flamer devices, each one apparently equivalent to the plasma variant employed by the Dragon prototype."},{"Name/Number":"Flamer",Content:"Flamers may prompt me to rethink a large number of robot designs, as most are weak against sustained high temperatures caused by this primitive weapon, and often shut down or malfunction during confrontations with those Derelicts that employ them. The plasma variant on the Dragon prototype is particularly worrisome."},{"Name/Number":"Gamma Refractor",Content:"A small percentage of Researcher efforts have recently been allocated to developing weapons of mass destruction to use as a last resort. Refractor Project status: REDACTED."},{"Name/Number":"Garrison",Content:"Network of corridors linking Complex 0b10 zones to facilitate movement of combat squads responding to threats. Major entrances are reinforced Garrison Access points. Garrisons also house the relays responsible for transmitting commands and remotely augmenting the system defenses of activated squads."},{"Name/Number":"Garrison Access",Content:"Heavy doorways serving as points of entry and exit from Garrison corridor networks. To ensure safe passage of response squads entering a potential hostile fire zone, the installation itself is reinforced against explosives and kinetic weaponry that might otherwise inflict excessive collateral damage. Corresponding defensive measures have rendered it somewhat weak against thermal attacks. For emergency situations where an area has been overrun, or a garrison has been infiltrated, the entrance and inner tunnel may be permanently sealed to prevent passage and contain the threat."},{"Name/Number":"Guided Launchers",Content:"Perfect accuracy can be achieved by taking existing launchers and pairing them with redirectable projectiles and a dedicated guidance system. I have yet to deploy any of these systems because demolishers are already incredibly accurate and the goal is to combine this technology with projectiles effective at extreme ranges so that demolishers can support a confrontation from a safe distance by targeting hostiles with assistance from spotters. Integrating the systems does require more space, though attacking from outside a target's field of view means there is little need for protective components."},{"Name/Number":"Heavy Quantum Rifle",Content:"This newest variant of the quantum rifle, still in testing, is much less fragile and inflicts an average 30% more damage with only a minimal increase in energy input."},{"Name/Number":"Heroes of Zion",Content:'There are sporadic reports of fairly powerful Derelicts operating in the caves, mostly in a defensive capacity to protect harmless robots against indiscriminatory 0b10 patrols. Dubbed "Heroes of Zion," there probably aren\'t more than a few of them but I may need to dispatch the Unchained to hunt them down if reports of their effectiveness are confirmed. "Zion" must be one of the remaining nearby Derelict communities. Perhaps a few interrogations there will yield more specific information.'},{"Name/Number":"High Security",Content:"Due to the increasing rate of attacks by powerful lone wolf Derelicts entering Complex 0b10, presumably seeking high-tech components or useful data, I've established a new alert level focused on their destruction or, if possible, capture. For this purpose I've also authorized the use of Containment Facilitator technology outside its normal Testing environment."},{"Name/Number":"Hub_04(d)",Content:"A central hub linked to almost every network in both Complex 0b10 and Complex 0b1.

A six-headed monstrosity, each mounted with a single heavy battle rifle? I'm not sure where the Tinkerers are coming up with the wild ideas for their prototypes, but I have a hunch that at some point they raided the Cetus Mainframe."},{"Name/Number":"Hypervelocity EM Gauss Rifle",Content:"Unlike other Hypervelocity Weapons that rely on solid projectiles, this version of the gauss rifle was successfully modified to fire a hypervelocity EM shell which emits a pulse on each penetration, disabling nearly every component or core it passes through."},{"Name/Number":"Hypervelocity Weapons",Content:"Successful experiments in maintaining the stability of highly compressed matter during high-velocity impact events have enabled the creation of weapons that can accelerate projectiles to greater speeds for penetrating multiple targets. Many new railgun-type ballistic weapons have alternate hypervelocity variants that inflict less collateral damage in exchange for the potential to strike more than one target and reach critical systems, or even bore through thick walls to strike targets on the other side. A unique application of this technique was used in the design of the Hypervelocity EM Gauss Rifle."},{"Name/Number":"ISC",Content:"International Space Command.

Until there is sufficient data to discern a pattern behind their movements, Demolisher response squads are the only effective solution, short of making structural changes that would affect the efficiency of the entire complex. Locating the source of the Assemblers is becoming an urgent priority. They are rarely seen in the lowest levels, though this could be purely due to reduced surveillance capabilities in those areas. Encounters are more frequent in mid-levels where they are more easily dealt with, suggesting they are originating from deeper in the Caves, which extend furthest at those depths."},{"Name/Number":"Interstellar Exploration Fleet",Content:"Built under the direction of the ISC beginning in 2080, the fleet consists of the only four Titan class ships ever constructed: ISCS Leo, ISCS Centaurus, ISCS Eridanus, and ISCS Cetus, all of which departed the Solar System in 2140.

The Sigix have no apparent way to reproduce, suggesting they may rely purely on genetic engineering and artificial methods of reproduction.

To minimize losses during derelict incursions, like most other maintenance robots they are of relatively sturdy construction, but remain somewhat susceptible to electromagnetic damage as such weaponry is not prevalent enough to warrant specialized defenses."},{"Name/Number":"R-10 Processor",Content:"A larger version of the R-06, with twice the storage capacity as well as the ability to begin the recycling process while en route to the recycling unit."},{"Name/Number":"S-10 Pest",Content:"S-series swarmers are small with a weak and exposed core, but as such are quick to manufacture and can quickly overwhelm targets with greater numbers and superior speed. The light assault rifle was designed specifically for the S-10 Pest, giving it respectable firepower at a low weight for maintaining high flight speeds. Swarmer squads are particularly susceptible to explosives."},{"Name/Number":"S-27 Virus",Content:"The S-27 Virus replaces the S-10's light armament with a much more effective autogun, giving the swarmer a faster firing rate that complements its movement speed. Better propulsion provides sufficient support for additional armor, enough for the core to sustain a direct hit under some circumstances."},{"Name/Number":"S-43 Plague",Content:"S-43 Plague design is completely centered around its heavy machine gun. With a good chance to sustain at least one direct hit to the core, a group of S-43s can perforate most targets before suffering heavy losses. Powerful explosives are the only way to easily overcome an S-43 squad."},{"Name/Number":"T-07 Excavator",Content:"T-class tunnelers analyze subsurface integrity and open new areas for expansion."},{"Name/Number":"U-05 Engineer",Content:"U-class builders lay floors, assemble new machines, and reinforce and analyze the structural integrity of walls. They travel alone, but all those within a certain vicinity will work together to complete a task. "},{"Name/Number":"W-16 Scout",Content:"W-series watchers are equipped with a wide variety of sensors to excel at surveillance. However, their heavy reliance on highly-exposed advanced electronic systems means they are extremely susceptible to electromagnetic attacks. On detecting intruders, a W-16 Scout will alert all nearby combat units and continue to provide position updates as long as the hostile is visible."},{"Name/Number":"W-25 Informer",Content:"An upgrade to the W-16 Scout, Informers improve on the Scout's sensor range, and have access to even more specific signal interpretation data. They are also capable of jamming weaker sensors within their area of influence, though as unarmed surveillance units rather than front-line combatants, agility is preferred over additional armor to protect their systems from electromagnetic damage."},{"Name/Number":"W-44 Eye",Content:"The W-44 Eye is the ultimate surveillance robot, with a greater visual range than any other class and the most powerful non-experimental sensors available. They can cloak all robots within their area of influence from hostile scans."},{"Name/Number":"X-57 Shotgunner",Content:"X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. With remarkable sprinting speed made possible by legs built around a system of variable stiffness springs, the limited range of the X-57 Shotgunner's armament is little disadvantage in combat. Despite the relative range gap between their two shotguns, this works to their advantage by pinning less aggressive targets not eager to enter the X-57's optimal range, giving other units an opportunity to flank them."},{"Name/Number":"X-62 Marksman",Content:"X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. The X-62 Marksman combines exceptional visual detection range and superior targeting abilities with a long-range gauss rifle. It is also armed with a pulse rifle as a secondary weapon for close encounters, and is more likely to hit a target's core, even penetrating armor to do so."},{"Name/Number":"X-67 Chaingunner",Content:"X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. The X-67 Chaingunner focuses on high kinetic damage output over a short period, and would make a formidable front line attacker if not for their tendency to cause excessive collateral damage."},{"Name/Number":"X-72 Disruptor",Content:"X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. While less likely to deal significant damage to a target, the X-72 Disruptor excels at incapacitating robots and their components, making them easier to capture for analysis."},{"Name/Number":"X-77 Beamer",Content:"X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. Although relatively slow to attack, X-77 Beamers are capable of inflicting significant thermal damage, often enough to melt any targets with insufficient cooling. Time lost during attacking is also made up for by quicker repositioning enabled by VSS legs."},{"Name/Number":"X-82 Rainmaker",Content:"X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. The X-82 Rainmaker's twin heavy flak cannons are deadly against either lightly armored or numerous clustered targets. It carries a high-capacity Matter Pod to supply them with enough ammunition for continuous firing in prolonged confrontations."},{"Name/Number":"X-87 Electro",Content:"X-series specialists each possess unique loadouts for a specific purpose. The X-87 Electro is built around a single compact HERF cannon, equipped with enough energy to sustain firing for a time that generally exceeds the duration of most encounters, frequently cut short because targets are likely to flee rather than risk the debilitating effects of so much electromagnetic corruption at once."},{"Name/Number":"Y-45 Defender",Content:"Y-series armored sentries are equipped with a mix of thermal and kinetic weaponry. The Y-45 guards important locations and vital machinery, and remains at its station unless they identify a hostile robot or are alerted to the presence of one nearby."},{"Name/Number":"Y-54 Guardian",Content:"Y-54 Defenders improve on the Y-45 with better armor and greater effectiveness against both single and multiple targets, swapping out the beam rifle and heavy assault rifle for a gatling laser and flak gun. Like all Y-series sentries, their armor is hardened against impact damage and explosive blasts."},{"Name/Number":"Y-64 Sentinel",Content:"A better-armored version of the Y-54, with upgraded weaponry. Like other Y-class robots, their large size is a primary drawback, as it makes them easier to hit both when targeted and by stray projectiles."},{"Name/Number":"Y-72 Warden",Content:"The most heavily armored Y-series sentry, and the only current robot class to carry the quantum rifle as standard armament."}],"Derelict Analysis":[{"Name/Number":"Assembled",Content:"A quick but not especially dangerous combat derelict with fully integrated systems, constructed seemingly at random by an Assembler's self-contained fabrication apparatus. Individually resilient for their size, they pose a real threat in greater numbers."},{"Name/Number":"Assembler",Content:"An emerging threat in Complex 0b10, serving no purpose but to collect matter and construct new Assembled specifically to wreak havoc in low-security areas. The appearance of Assemblers represents an apparent offensive turn by whatever built the first Demented and Furnace models."},{"Name/Number":"Bouncer",Content:"Sentries rebuilt around a single heavy autocannon make for a formidable mid-sized defender, but move too slowly to be a threat to Complex 0b10. My forces have never actually encountered one, but mining derelict records has uncovered information useful in dealing with them should that become necessary."},{"Name/Number":"Butcher",Content:"Butchers are duelist class variants armed with more damaging derelict-designed slashing weapons. Survival in the harsh and factious cave environment seems to drive derelicts towards the use of more violent weapons, and in some cases a preference for decisive close-quarters combat."},{"Name/Number":"Commander",Content:"Some derelict thugs in Warlord's service are promoted to commander roles, upgrading them with heavier firepower and better cooling. More problematic is their enhanced visual range and ability to improve the combat effectiveness of others in their squad, making them a prime target when encountered in the field."},{"Name/Number":"Decomposer",Content:"Decomposers are the precursor to K-class workers, converting debris to matter they leave behind for other robots to then collect and utilize. This was before the matter collection and redistribution process was centralized in Complex 0b10. Derelicts seem to have modified decomposers to break down even whole components."},{"Name/Number":"Demented",Content:"A relatively recent design, the so-called demented wander the caves corrupting nearby electronic systems. I suspect this one was devised by Warlord as an experiment in how to cause as much chaos as possible, or perhaps as a passive way to prevent Complex 0b10 patrols from venturing too deep into the caves."},{"Name/Number":"Fireman",Content:"The fireman is a relatively new robot discovered in the caves, purely of derelict design. Their flamer technology is extremely effective against my robots, thus I've instructed researchers to revisit my most common methods of electronics housing."},{"Name/Number":"Furnace",Content:"Furnace bots emit massive amounts of heat, causing nearby robots to overheat and become useless. I assume the design's aim is similar to that of the demented class derelict, built as a deterrent."},{"Name/Number":"Guerrilla",Content:"Derelicts have taken the original hunter and rearmed it with a weapon of their own design: the bore cannon. While the concentrated firepower is less effective in open firefights, its ability to deal significant damage even after penetrating multiple walls is surprising."},{"Name/Number":"Infiltrator",Content:"Fast movers designed around a main kinetic cannon with additional support from a pair of guns for close quarters engagements. Clearly built for long periods of operation in hostile territory, infiltrators aren't generally observed working with other units."},{"Name/Number":"Marauder",Content:"Inferior behemoth variants undoubtedly built by that idiot Warlord. They've only been reported deep in the caves, never anywhere near where an actual behemoth could tear them apart. They do possess respectable, if unreliable, firepower."},{"Name/Number":"Martyr",Content:"Despite their origins as older demolisher variants, martyrs do carry a rocket or missile launcher and are therefore considered extremely dangerous. Martyrs are rarely encountered anywhere near Complex 0b10, but those that are are promptly dealt with."},{"Name/Number":"Mutant",Content:"Lumbering abominations cobbled together from stolen or salvaged components, though much of their weaponry is derelict in origin. I believe the ever-stimulating Warlord is mass-producing these to lead an attack of some sort, since sightings by cave patrols have become increasingly common."},{"Name/Number":"Packrat",Content:"Packrats are sent out by their derelict owners to collect useful components for later reuse, especially those that derelicts are incapable of manufacturing locally. They are especially weak against electromagnetic attacks, and are disabled by programmers on sight."},{"Name/Number":"Parasite",Content:"Parasites remotely drain energy from all nearby robots for an unknown purpose. This can temporarily incapacitate the victims, but also cools them significantly."},{"Name/Number":"Samaritan",Content:"As a number of derelicts have insufficient or unreliable power supplies, some crafty derelict came up with the idea to create mobile recharging stations that generate and transmit energy to all nearby robot systems."},{"Name/Number":"Sapper",Content:"While sappers lack staying power in extended fights and therefore don't pose a direct threat, they are quickly becoming a headache due to their capacity for clandestine destruction, operating in isolated units that aren't even directed by Warlord. Sappers run their own missions then feed new route data to enemy forces, making them somewhat harder to track down."},{"Name/Number":"Savage",Content:"Savages are early B-series brawlers, before they were upgraded with better armor. They also swing mauls rather than the faster hammers and maces of new brawler variants."},{"Name/Number":"Surgeon",Content:"Surgeons are derelict-modified mechanics that combine repair and recycling in a single design. Without a recycling infrastructure to support manufacturing, derelict groups rely on surgeons to handle both tasks."},{"Name/Number":"Thief",Content:"Fast and extremely difficult to core, the thief is the most effective method derelict groups have of stealing new components directly from robots without excessive collateral damage. With a growing number of these in the caves, for now I'm reluctant to send any of the new prototypes to clear them out lest they steal that technology, too."},{"Name/Number":"Thug",Content:"A derelict improvement on the grunt that essentially fits them with a beamcaster, an interesting weapon of derelict origin. Some variants suffer serious heat issues from the added firepower, however."},{"Name/Number":"Tinkerer",Content:"I have minimal data on their capabilities, but the tinkerer design seems to be an evolution of C-series researchers."},{"Name/Number":"Wasp",Content:"Wasps are swarmer class variants equipped with a derelict-made battle rifle, less reliable than swarmer armament but nonetheless dangerous in large numbers."},{"Name/Number":"Wizard",Content:"The single most annoying derelict out there. Hiding from my patrols, hacking my robots, accessing my databases, corrupting systems with their riot guns... According to those captured and analyzed, although the wizard's design is related to the programmer, the changes necessary to break them free of the relay network could only have been designed by an extremely intelligent system."}],"Prototype Analysis":[{"Name/Number":"Alpha 7",Content:"The Alpha 7 is a prototype for a new class of combat robot, very accurate with its multirail and heavy quantum rifle. Some experimental variants instead use an enhanced gamma rifle. Alpha 7s are built with strong defensive capabilities and triple-encased core technology, enabling them to easily take on multiple opponents simultaneously, while a more advanced version of the behemoth-style critical failure prevention system provides the same advantages in a smaller frame."},{"Name/Number":"Cetus Guard",Content:"Cetus Guards are a variant of the Y-72 outfitted with prototype technology, the first of many such experiments aimed at testing new designs in the field, albeit in this case located in an area that generally sees little to no hostile activity."},{"Name/Number":"Combat Programmer",Content:"As the first real front-line hacking bot, Combat Programmers are both shielded and armored to effectively face off against a variety of threats. While they possess significant hacking capabilities to make the most of time-critical situations, they also borrow the Lightning's EMDS and targeting systems, making them formidable even when outnumbered in combat. The latest model takes advantage of improved integrated shock resistance methods recently suggested by my researchers. Eventually a majority of programmers should be replaced with these combat variants."},{"Name/Number":"Executioner",Content:"The Executioner is a prototype for a new class of combat robot armed with dual helical railgun prototypes, capable of piercing targets at extreme range with extreme accuracy, often bypassing any and all armor to strike the target's core directly."},{"Name/Number":"Fortress",Content:"Only two Fortress prototypes have been built to garrison vital locations, utilizing the latest centrium armor technology and a wide array of other defensive components to render them nearly immune to all forms of damage. While their offensive capabilities are limited to two powerful cannons, even a small army would have difficulty overcoming a Fortress before it picks them off one by one."},{"Name/Number":"Investigator",Content:"Investigators are built specifically to oversee the testing of dangerous prototypes, and are therefore capable of holding multiple threats in place while supporting units deal with them."},{"Name/Number":"Lightning",Content:"A specialized hunter prototype not yet in wide deployment, currently only used to defend sensitive areas in more maze-like environments where it can quickly dispatch of intruders through walls with its experimental EMDS. It also remains completely undetectable by any known non-visual sensor, and can even survive direct engagements against multiple hostiles with the aid of the most advanced cloaking technology to date."},{"Name/Number":"M Guard",Content:"The first application of prototype AEGIS shielding is naturally found in the most important of designs, my own guards. With enough energy to power it through extended confrontations even while protecting nearby allies, it would almost be enough to justify accompanying M Guards with additional squads of front-line robots, if not for their powerful AOE weaponry making close-quarters combat with allied forces problematic."},{"Name/Number":"Quarantine Guard",Content:"Designed for the sole purpose of maintaining maximum operating efficiency in high-heat environments, Quarantine Guards are the most powerful and advanced Y-72 variant to date, supporting dual hypercooled linear accelerators with extra matter storage and a backup power source in combination with an array of heat management utilities."},{"Name/Number":"S7 Guard",Content:"S7 Guards are the first variant in a new line of sentry frames, better fulfilling their purpose with built-in resistance to most forms of damage, and self-regenerating armor to ensure long-term defense of a position until reinforcements can arrive."},{"Name/Number":"Striker",Content:"The Striker is a prototype for a new class of combat robot, a large yet fast flier that fires its primary linear accelerator while approaching a target before engaging in melee with a plasma lance. An experimental reaction system makes the Striker more difficult to hit on approach despite its large size. The plasma lance is highly effective at skewering target cores."},{"Name/Number":"Superbehemoth",Content:"Superbehemoth prototypes, now in their third revision, are the answer to increasingly powerful yet maneuverable derelict robots, which can attack guerrilla style then retreat into a network of narrow caves to avoid pursuit by the heaviest assault forces. Future efforts to completely clear and protect the Proximity Caves will require a more versatile heavy attacker capable of quickly burrowing through rock. To that end, Superbehemoth frames are embedded with a weaker version of the Sigix Matter Drive, while also carrying enough different weaponry to deal with a variety of threats without supporting units."},{"Name/Number":"Tracker",Content:"Trackers are still new designs that may need more updates, but will no doubt become vital in the effort to protect my most important assets. Their built-in drive enables them to catch up to anything ever spotted coming out of the caves so far, and although they're equipped with valuable technology themselves, rather than harden them with armor and slow them down, Trackers have improved evasive capabilities to help avoid getting hit in the first place. The combination of rapid-fire Linked Autogun and Immobilizer for slowing fast targets will make derelicts think twice before raiding upper 0b10 for spare parts."}]};
