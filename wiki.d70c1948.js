Stealth builds will have a difficult time of sneaking past unnoticed and combat bots must be ready to do a lot of killing to get by.

It is a non-[[0b10]]-controlled map where [[Derelict|Derelicts]] often roam free and hostile 0b10 squads patrol and can be taken out without fear of reinforcements. Non-patrolling 0b10 outposts guarded by a [[Sentry]] and dormant bots are common. Every depth has 2 guaranteed Caves exits and each Caves map is a part of a series of 3 maps in a row. Not counting event-based exits, all first Caves maps of each depth can only be exited by entering the second Caves map. Caves maps do not have very many regular parts on the ground, but piles of [[Scrap]] contain usable but partially damaged parts and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can give unique intel about upcoming floors.\nThere are different names for the different types of Caves maps and they have slightly different characteristics. Lower Caves is the name given to the first 2 Caves maps on -7 and -6, while Caves maps on -5 and -4 are named Upper Caves. The third caves map is accessible only by exiting the depth-specific special branch at the left side of the second caves map and is called Proximity Caves, regardless of depth. Lower and Upper Caves are very similar in all but [[Robot Tier]], but Proximity Caves tends to be more densely populated with patrols.\nCaves are patrolled fairly lightly by hostile 0b10 bots compared to the main floors. [[Infowar]] utilities are a good option to avoid unnecessary encounters as many patrols can be avoided with a bit of patience. Caves have a unique mechanic where parts dropped from 0b10 bots will automatically self-destruct after a few turns. Looting must be done quickly or else the dropped parts will be lost forever. The only 2 ways around this mechanic are [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]] and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]]. The interrupters will prevent the parts from frying while active and EM damage will interfere with the self-destruct mechanism. While EM will give [[Corrupted Parts]], it is far better to end up with corrupted parts than to end up with no parts at all.\nDue to the low rate of good parts spawning on the floor and the overall difficulty in looting hostile 0b10 bots, it is very easy for an unprepared build to fall apart in these maps. Bringing plenty of spares into Caves is highly recommended to avoid running out of essentials like propulsion, weapons, and armor. [[Launchers]] are a must here to handle ambushes of large numbers of 0b10 bots hiding in outposts. Launchers are also incredibly useful when entering a Caves map because the standard spawn protection that is present in 0b10 maps doesn\'t apply here. That means that one (or more) patrols can appear right in Cogmind\'s face on entering a map.\n[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Caves[[/Lore]]\n[[Heading]]Navigation[[/Heading]]\nCave maps all have a very similar overall layout. While the paths within the caves are unpredictable, these maps can typically be divided into 6 equal chunks. Top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, and bottom right. Cogmind will always spawn from the top right or bottom right chunks in Lower and Upper Caves or the top left or bottom left chunks in Proximity caves. One exit will always be in the chunk furthest from Cogmind. In the second Lower or Upper Caves map, the unique branch exit will be in that furthest chunk and the exit back to the main floor will always be on the same side. A good rule of thumb is that left is away from 0b10 while right is toward 0b10.\n[[Heading]]Prefabs[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Caves Assembled Tinkerer.png|A [[Tinkerer]] hiding behind some [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]]|Caves PL-HR7.png|Tinkerer PL-HR7 and [[Warlord Statue]] with a [[Heart of Steel]]|Caves MolDe.png|Tinkerer with a [[Molecular Deconstructor]] hiding behind a wall|Caves CE.png|Tinkerer with a [[Core Expander]] hidden behind a wall|Caves Broken Bots.png|Broken bots next to some damaged parts|Caves Hostile Mutant 1.png|Hostile [[Mutant]] guarding a stash of parts|Caves Hostile Mutant 2.png|Hostile Mutant guarding a collection of rewirable bots|Caves Hostile Thug.png|Hostile [[Thug]] guarding some disabled [[Savage|Savages]]|Caves Thief Base.png|[[Thief]] base with some presumably stolen parts|Caves Hauler Escort.png|[[Hauler]] escorted by some [[Grunt|Grunts]]|Caves Hunter Programmer Ambush.png|0b10 bots hiding in a wall to ambush Cogmind|Caves Unguarded Cache.png|Unguarded cache of parts out of sight|Caves Dirty Datajack Cache.png|Unguarded cache of [[Dirty Datajack|Dirty Datajacks]] out of sight|Caves Scrap Pile.png|Big cache of [[Scrap]]|Caves DNI.png|[[Dimensional Node Initializer]] hidden behind some sealed doors|Caves Outpost 1.png|0b10 outpost of dormant bots guarding an intel [[Terminal]]|Caves Outpost 2.png|0b10 outpost of [[Sentry]] and dormant bots guarding rewirable bots|Caves Outpost 3.png|Attacked 0b10 outpost|Caves Mega Outpost.png|Huge 0b10 outpost of Sentries and dormant bots|Caves Hostile Guards.png|0b10 guard bots|Caves Demolisher Base.png|Proximity Caves [[Demolisher]] testing base exit|Caves Huge Base.png|Huge 0b10 base exit|Caves Sapper Base.png|Friendly outpost of [[Sapper|Sappers]]|Caves Friendly Warlord Outpost.png|Friendly outpost of [[Warlord]]-aligned Derelict bots|Caves Friendly Derelicts.png|Friendly [[Derelict|Derelicts]] standing guard|Caves Reappropriated Outpost.png|"Reappropriated" Derelict outpost|Caves Attacked Warlord Outpost.png|Attacked Warlord Derelict outpost|Caves Invaded Warlord Outpost.png|0b10-controlled Warlord outpost|Caves Hostile Derelicts Outpost.png|Hostile Derelict outpost|Caves Graveyard.png|Graveyard of broken Derelict bots[[/Gallery]]\nCaves has one of the largest collections of prefabs of all the maps in the game There is a wide mix of good and bad prefabs. One of the strongest prefabs, the Tinkerer with a [[Core Expander]], is so strong that it alone can be a good reason to go into Caves. The most common encounters on this map tend to be the many different forms of 0b10 outposts. [[Transmission Jammer|Transmission Jammers]] are highly recommended to take bots in these outposts out one at a time without getting overwhelmed. In some hostile encounters, [[Sentry|Sentries]] can call for a reinforcement [[Assault Squad]]. In the first Caves map each depth only no reinforcements will come as there is no 0b10-controlled exit. Killing the Sentries as quickly as possible is highly recommended in all other cases. Fighting these outposts is a bad idea for an unprepared build, but larger outposts with Terminal intel are very vaulable. This intel can be the same as the intel found in [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]].\nFriendly Derelicts will not move from their guard position, but they will engage any 0b10 forces they see. Leading hostile squads into them can let them do the fighting for you. This is particularly easy to do for fast airborne builds who don\'t want to engage in combat and can use the Derelicts as a distraction. These Derelicts can also be safely salvaged for parts and will not retaliate.\n[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Caves Huge Base Assault.png|Derelicts attacking a huge 0b10 base exit[[/Image]][[Image]]Caves Outpost Assembled Invasion.png|[[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] infesting an abandoned outpost[[/Image]]\n[[List]](++) [[Z-Hero]] Rescue: If Cogmind is low on core integrity and under fire, a Z-Hero can appear and fight off the attackers.

In the center is the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine, a few scattered lore [[Terminal|Terminals]], and a Terminal that locks up the Cetus Mainframe.\nIf [[A7]] is rescued and kept alive, they will provide a special Terminal hack for the manufacturing module that will create 5 Cogmind-controlled [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. A7 also has a special interaction upon seeing the Cetus Mainframe.

After destroying all 8 Cetus Guards, they will appear and thank you for freeing them. If both Revision 17 and the Cetus Manufacturing Module are still intact when leaving the map, there will be a special -3 [[Research]] event where Revision 17 attacks the map.\nThere are no standard [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] or [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on this map. However, there is a special patrol [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] spawn. 750 turns after entering the map and every further 250 turns, 2 ARCs will spawn from random exits and roam around the map. It is best to exit the map before too many of these ARCs start showing up.\n[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]Cetus Records|Cetus Mainframe[[/Lore]]\n[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]\nThe [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] are not too tough of foes and have some very nice loot, especially the [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], [[Centrium Heavy Treads]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]]. They have an above average amount of core integrity but no critical destroy immunity or EM resistance, so destroy crit and EM weapons tend to be the most effective. EM Launchers are particularly effective at taking out each chunk of 4 in a short amount of time. There will be some [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] parts, but this loot is definitely worth the corruption. \nCogmind will often have a big group of allies from Extension. These can be helpful and harmful at the same time. Too many allies will just get in the way of each other and you, so telling some controllable allies to stay back is often a good idea. While the [[Guerrilla (5)|Guerillas]] have -Salvage from their [[Bore Cannon]], they tend to perform very well against the Cetus Guards due to their very high critical destroy chance.\nTo best preserve the Cetus Manufacturing Module for the A7 code or Revision 17 events, tell all controllable allies to stay at the first intersection after killing the first set of Cetus Guards. This will cause any ARCs that spawn from the top-left exit to fight those allies out of the way. Otherwise, Enhanced Grunts being created via the A7 code will often fight right in front of the module and cause the machine to get destroyed by wandering patrols trying to fight.\nThe Cetus Mainframe door has a very low base success rate of 10%. While [[Hackware]] can help out here, the Cetus Guards can conveniently drop a [[Adv. Variable Charge Gun]] which can be overloaded to destroy the Sealed Heavy Doors. Otherwise, any rating 3 or higher [[Impact Weapons|Impact Weapon]] can destroy the Reinforced Barrier around it.\n[[Heading]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 3 exits on this map but only 2 kinds of exits:\n[[List]]Main access exits: The exits on the top left/right corners of the map will lead to the next main Factory or Research floor.|[[Archives]]: The exit on the bottom right corner leads to Archives.[[/List]]",Exits:["Factory","Archives","Research"],SpecialBots:["Cetus Guard","Enhanced Grunt","Revision 17"],MinDepth:-6,MaxDepth:-4,Branch:!0,Spoiler:"Spoiler"},{Name:"Command",ImageName:"Command.png",Content:"",Exits:["Surface","Access_0"],SpecialBots:["Combat Programmer","Enhanced Q-Series","M Guard","MAIN.C","MAIN.C (Shell)"],SpecialItems:["AEGIS Remote Shield","Cld.

If you have any [[Corruption]], make sure to detach all ranged weapons to avoid accidental misfires.\nThere are 4 unique Terminals on the bottom side of the map. The left 2 contain mostly lore records, although the top-left Terminal will also list the depth of [[Section 7]] as well as the access code to the [[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] Prototype Stash. These two vary per run so make sure to grab these lore entries every time. The bottom ones do not contain any additional information each run. The top-right Terminal will contain several random bot [[Schematic|Schematics]] and the bottom-right Terminal will contain a large number of part schematics and a few Prototype ID Banks. The part schematics will always contain schematics for [[Combat Drone Bay]] and [[Lgt.

[[Investigation Squad|Investigations]], [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]], and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on all [[0b10]]-controlled floors have a chance to be redirected to another random place on the map. For Reinforcements and Assaults, this will result in their permanent repositioning. This is a benefit most of the time, although on cramped maps it can be a downside because bots can be grouped together at bad positions.

[[Tracker|Trackers]] can easily chew up any airborne build with their deadly [[Immobilizer]] to halt any chance of escape with their highly accurate [[Linked Autogun]] to put out the damage. Adequately prepared combat builds can usually dispatch the Trackers without too much trouble and use their Linked Autoguns to great effect. Each Tracker will also summon a [[Combat Programmer]] which is a high-damaging foe that will quickly rack up corruption. Unlike [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], Intercepts are move-based and not tile-based and tends to punish airborne builds relatively more than combat builds. When using the Data Conduit, Cogmind should either be prepared to exit maps quickly to avoid Intercept encounters or have a plan to fight.\n[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]\nKilling the Data Miner himself is highly luck based with only a few ways to improve the chances. A successful Data Miner kill can yield up to 4 pieces of Prototype Hackware at an early depth. Ranged weapons are almost entirely out of the question because he will escape after the first weapon in a volley. However, melee weapon follow-ups will not cause the trap door to activate in between the volley. The primary ways to increase kill chance are to:\n[[List]]Use as many weapon slots with melee weapons as possible|Use [[Actuator Arrays]] to increase followup chance|Use [[Core Analyzers]] to increase core hit chance|Use [[Momentum]] to increase damage|Use [[Force Boosters]] to increase damage[[/List]]\nOne alternate approach is to use the [[Field Lobotomy Kit]] to assimilate the Data Miner before killing to guarantee a kill. Using a [[Plasma Cutter]] as well can almost guarantee all 4 pieces of Hackware as a drop. It is safe to do this on this map without attracting hostilities.\n[[Heading:2]][[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]][[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Data Miner Combat Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to fight Grunts[[/Image]]\nAfter the Data Miner is attacked these grunts hidden in the wall will burst out and become aggressive.

There are disabled and rewirable bots on the map and random parts on the ground. Farcom is not obtainable on this seed, but one random vault prototype is available by using the manual code [[Spoiler:Spoiler]]\\\\1234[[/Spoiler]] on the vault terminal.|While not changing the map in any way, there is a chance that a large [[0b10]] attack force will assault the Exiles base after using the Farcom machine and exiting the vault.[[/List]]\n[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]\nFighting the Exiles is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. Although they are normally friendly, they can pack quite a punch and will likely end the run of any unprepared player. As far as rewards go, [[8R-AWN]] has some powerful unique [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] with a high salvage and destroy critical %, out-of-depth parts including [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Adv. Weapon Cycler]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and [[Adv. Myomer Leg]]. Another unique part, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] is very helpful in a later game branch [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Other useful parts on some of the Exiles themselves are [[Adv. Component Analysis Suite]], [[System Purifier]], [[Cmb. Antigrav System]], [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]], [[Exp. Core Analyzer]], and [[Adv. Transmission Jammer]].\n[[Image]]Exiles Kill Build.png|Example Exiles kill build[[/Image]]\nFighting the Exiles is not recommended on -10 due to lower slot count, lower core integrity, and difficulty in getting enough integrity to survive the 8R-AWN fight. If fighting on -9, evolving a 3rd weapon slot can be very effective in killing 8R-AWN and any potential [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] that might spawn in the next Mines map. The third weapon slot is not required to kill by any means, however, and any combination of weapon, utility, and propulsion slots for the evolve will work. As a basic checklist, the following parts are recommended:[[List]]Multiple kinetic guns with backups, ideally [[Hvy. Assault Rifle|Hvy. Assault Rifles]] or [[Imp. Assault Rifle|Imp. Assault Rifles]], weapons with negative salvage like [[Shotgun]] or a ballistic cannon like [[Imp. Light Cannon]] can work but 8R-AWN has very strong loot that is nice to get if possible|Multiple pieces of armor, preferably [[Hrd. Light Armor Plating]] or [[Med. Armor Plating]]|Multiple [[Lgt. Treads]] or [[Imp. Treads]] with backups|At least one launcher like [[Grenade Launcher]], [[Mni. Grenade Launcher]], or [[Rocket Launcher]]|(Optional) A way to gain positive salvage like a [[Plasma Cutter]] or [[Salvage Targeting Computer]], in a pinch ramming 8R-AWN can provide a bit of salvage (+3 per ram)|(Optional) [[Blade Trap|Blade Traps]] for 8R-AWN or [[Explosive Trap|Explosive Traps]] for the Assembled, if an early trap extractor or trap stockpile are found in Mines[[/List]]\n[[Image]]Exiles Kill.png|A visual guide to killing the Exiles[[/Image]]\nThere are some things that should be done before actually doing the fight itself. The image on the right serves as a visual reference. Any rigged engines used must be in inventory before attacking the Exiles, otherwise the engines will still remain loyal to the Exiles and explode only on Cogmind. Traps should also be set before any hostilities begin. Blade Traps should be placed along the north edge of the wall after 8R-AWN to ensure that they are triggered and Explosive Traps should be placed next to the [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] to hit them while they are grouped up together. Matter pods should be relocated near the 8R-AWN fighting spot (See point #4 in diagram) to avoid running out of matter in combat. Any allies should be told to stay in the same general area so they can contribute to the fight. However, Grunts can't deal much damage until [[8R-AWN's Armor/TH]] is destroyed. Finally, some vault items may come in handy for the fight. The [[Cloak of Protection]]'s effect is not so strong, but when turned off it is a high coverage high integrity piece of armor. The [[Longsword +1]] is a very effective kill tool. The [[Potential Leg|Potential Legs]] have a lot of integrity in case you run out of propulsion during the fight. The [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]] may be used to safely destroy the [[DAS Turret]] without getting attacked back. One thing to consider about the vault is that there may be a 0b10 attack on the Exiles after exiting. In those cases, an Exiles kill may either have to be cancelled or at least turned into a 8R-AWN only kill. Aside from that, the fight may begin:\n[[Image]]Exiles Launcher DAS.png|Launchering the DAS turret[[/Image]]\n[[List:Ordered]]Shoot one of the spike-shaped machines to turn the Exiles hostile.|Drop the rigged engines from the entrance every few tiles while walking toward the spot for step #3, they have an explosion radius of 2. This will take care of most of the Assembled that are coming your way. IMPORTANT: This must be done after the Exiles become hostile. If you do it before that, they will explode on Cogmind.|Pull out a Launcher and dispose of the remaining Assembled.|Go to the corner to fight 8R-AWN. This is the part that needs the most backups, as 8R-AWN will destroy many of your parts very quickly due to high damage and high part destroy critical chance. Always put on backup parts right away after they are destroyed. Make sure to apply salvage with a Plasma Cutter if you have it before finishing the kill. You may run out of matter and have to refill from matter pods at this point, which is why preemptively moving the matter pods here can be very important. Many kill attempts that don't have enough damage or integrity will end here.|Hopefully you have some good loot after 8R-AWN is destroyed. [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] are a very easy way to destroy the [[DAS Turret]]. Penetrate through the machines to try and kill the turret without getting shot at because the cannon deals incredibly high damage. If no Boreguns were dropped, using a launcher is another good option. The idea is to aim around the spike in the machine so that you can't get hit but the explosion radius will still hit the turret.|Finally, all that is left is to loot the Exiles and their Derelict friends. Apply positive salvage to the Exiles with a Plasma Cutter if possible. Otherwise just finish them off with whatever you have left. Watch out for [[EX-DEC]] as they have a deadly [[AWS/EX-DEC]] that can deal a lot of damage very quickly if you aren't careful. It has a short range, so just take them out from a distance.[[/List]]",Exits:["Mines"],SpecialBots:["8R-AWN","EX-BIN","EX-DEC","EX-HEX"],SpecialItems:["0b10 Alert Chip","Army-in-a-Box","AWS/Autocannon","AWS/Gauss","AWS/Thermal","Chronowheel","Cloak of Protection","Deploy-a-Sentry","Field Lobotomy Kit","Firepult","Flying Fortress v7","Gui.

It is the beginning of a 4-map sequences of branches that spans Extension, Cetus, [[Archives]], and [[Hub_04(d)]]. It is an 0b10-controlled map with a small amount of patrols and moderate amount of guards spread throughout. There are a large amount of non-combat bots moving in between [[Transfer Station|Transfer Stations]] at the left and right-most parts of the map. Unlike most 0b10-controlled maps, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] will not spawn in Extension. The central area is heavily guarded with 2 [[Behemoth|Behemoths]] and 2 [[Sentry|Sentries]] standing by.\nThe overall map shape is similar to a large B turned on its side. This map shape is the same between runs, although every map has random contents. There is a single bottom path that runs straight to the main Factory/Cetus exits and 2 branching paths that contain some machines and disabled and imprisoned [[Derelict|Derelicts]]. One special NPC, [[A7]], is nearly always guaranteed to be locked in one of the cells. The central area has the aforementioned guards stationed as well as a [[Terminal]]-locked exit. The bottom path to either side of the central area can have Emergency Access doors along the top or bottom of the path. These can contain hostile guards, part caches, or nothing.\nOne unique mechanic to Extension is the persistant threat check. If too many non-combat bots are attacked and destroyed, an alert with the text [[GameText]]ALERT: Persistant threat to transfer network, dispatching additional forces.[[/GameText]] will appear, and 2 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will be dispatched to patrol the map.\n[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\nThere are two types of special machines in Extension. The first, the Transfer Station, is a machine that normally transports non-combat bots. When destroyed, each one will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50% amount. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]]. The other, Energy Cyclers, will open all Sealed Heavy Doors simulatenously when destroyed and summon several ARCs to patrol the map. This will free all of the locked up Derelicts and they will start heading in Cogmind's direction, fighting every hostile they see. Destroying either of these machines can be either good or bad, although the energy cycler effect is almost always bad.\n[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Extension[[/Lore]]\n[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]The strategy for Extension is a fairly simple one. From the spawn location, take the path to the top-left of the map. Travel along the right and destroy any hostiles. Rewiring and freeing bots in cells is an option at this point, but it is usually better to wait to do this to keep [[Alert]] lower and to preserve ally integrity for the center fight. When you reach the center area where the only path is down, there are 2 primary options:\n[[List]]Head back and loop back around counter-clockwise to the center of the map. Free/rewire any allies along the way. Take on the first Behemoth alone, then keep moving forward with your allies to finish the rest of the center area off.|Dig through the top-center part of the map. This is about 10 tiles long and is a risky dig with a high chance of one or more cave-ins. For a build with no allies and no good way to take on the central area, this may be a better risk to take than a head-on fight.[[/List]]\nAfter that, clear the top right section of the map to collect as many allies as possible, then head to the exits.\n[[Heading]]Prefabs[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Extension Energy Cycler.png|Energy Cycler machines|Extension Central Area.png|Central area with guards and locked exit|Extension Secret Cache.png|Cache of parts hidden behind Emergency Access|Extension Secret Guards.png|Group of guards hidden behind Emergency Access|Extension Rewirable Bots1.png|Rewirable bots with dormant guards|Extension Rewirable Bots2.png|Rewirable bots with awake guards|Extension Single Derelict Cell.png|Single Derelict prison cell|Extension Double Derelict Cell.png|Double Derelict prison cell with guard|Extension A7 Terminal.png|[[A7]] prison cell|Extension Broken Bots.png|Broken bots with damaged parts|Extension Exits.png|Exits with scattered parts[[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 2 exits right next to each other. The layout is always the same: The top path leads to Cetus and the lower path leads back to the next main floor, either Factory or Research.\n[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[List]](++) Derelict attack: There is an extremely rare event in which a large group of Derelicts attack Extension. The trigger conditions for this event are unknown.[[/List]]",Exits:["Factory","Cetus","Research"],SpecialBots:["A7"],MinDepth:-6,MaxDepth:-4,Branch:!0,Spoiler:"Spoiler"},{Name:"Factory",ImageName:"Factory.png",Content:"Factory is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that occurs on every floor between -7 and -4. It is the beginning of the midgame where the game really starts to open up. In stark contrast with earlier [[Materials]] maps, Factory start out huge with a ~200x200 tile map size. The rooms, the corridors, and the overall layout are all much wider and more open and connected than Materials. The patrols and guards are more spread out and stealth play with airborne propulsion and [[Infowar]] becomes a strong gameplay option.\n[[Alert]] starts to be more of a concern as the maps become bigger and harder to traverse. [[Hackware]] is useful to be able to successfully use Access hacks at terminals to locate exits. [[Signal Interpreter|Signal Interpreters]] will also be more useful at identifying exits as the exit types will be less predictable. [[Caves]] exits are available in every Factory map. They can be difficult if a player is unprepared, but they can provide many unique rewards and will typically result in a complete Alert purge by the time Cogmind makes it back to the next main floor.\nAs [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] become a regular occurrence, a large part of a build's effectiveness becomes how quickly Cogmind can kill Programmers. [[Corruption]] can build up very quickly if fighting multiple Programmers in open areas without a good way to kill them. Having strong thermal or kinetic weaponry is a good way to destroy them quickly. For lighter airborne builds, non-Impact melee weapons can work, although using Hackware to recall Exterminations is also very effective. This tends to be more important in later depths as Exterminations will upgrade from a single [[P-60 Hacker]] to 1-2 [[P-70 Sage]] per squad.\nThere are many new mechanics introduced beginning in Factory floors:\n[[List]][[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] begin to summon reinforcements when attacked if they contain [[Prototype Parts]]|[[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] begin to appear regularly|[[Fabricator|Fabricators]] can show up on the map|[[B-75 Beast|Behemoths]] can show up on the maps|[[Cargo Convoy|Cargo Convoys]] can travel through the map|[[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] can appear that will drop Cogmind into [[Wastes]]|[[DSF]] terminals will start to appear that can take you to DSF maps[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Factory[[/Lore]]\n[[Heading]]Prefabs[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Factory Main Exit.png|5 tile wide corridor dead ending into a Main Access|Factory Unknown Exit.png|Unknown exit, these types of intersection exits can lead to main or branch maps|Factory Locked Extension Exit.png|Locked exit into [[Extension]]|Factory Unlocked Extension Exit.png|Unlocked exit into [[Extension]]|Factory Dead End Armory Exit.png|Dead end exit into [[Armory]]|Factory Through Armory Exit.png|Corridor through exit into [[Armory]][[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 4 types of main exits on Factory floors:\n[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Factory or [[Research]]. Sometimes these exits can be identifiable by a 5 tile wide corridor leading to a dead-end with the exit in the middle. All other types of exits that aren't a part of a prefab can be either a main or branch exit. There will always be 4 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Caves]] exit: These exits can never be identified purely by looks. Using a [[Signal Interpreter]] or access hack to identify exits are the main ways to do so. There will always be 2 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Extension]] exit: Extension can always be identified by a distinctive prefab where a large area is sealed off by orange Blast Doors. These doors can be open or locked. If locked, the nearby [[Terminal]] will have an Open hack available to open the doors. Otherwise, shooting the walls open with strong thermal weaponry, causing an engine detonation with an EM launcher, or strong melee attacks can dig through or around these doors. Factory maps at the same depth as Extension will have 2 Extension exits.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: Armory can always be identified in Factory by a large 5 tile corridor leading into a 3 tile doorway. These exits will always be heavily guarded by a mix of [[Y-72 Warden|Sentries]] and [[G-67 Veteran|Grunts]] and have large stockpiles of weapons nearby. Factory maps at the same depth as Armory will have 1 of these types of exit.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]\n[[Image]]Factory DSF Exit.png|Hacked open DSF exit[[/Image]]\nSeveral non-standard exits also appear in Factory. [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] will throw Cogmind into [[Wastes]] which can end many good runs if unprepared. Using a [[Datajack]] on a [[K-01 Serf|Serf]] for the find_chute hack is very effective to either reveal traps to avoid or areas to head toward if planning to take on the [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] in combat.

It is much more similar to normal floors than the rest of the Extension branch maps where all of the normal squad types can spawn regularly.\n[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]\nThere are two types of special machines in Hub. The first, the [[Transfer Station]], is also common to Extension. When destroyed, it will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50%. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]].\n[[Image]]Hub Explosion.gif|A Network Hub explosion[[/Image]]The other, the Network Hub, is a large EM explosive machine. When destroyed, it will reduce all machine hacking trace capabilities by 20%. Every futher hub destroyed reduces by half that amount rounded down. In total, defenses are decreased by 20%, 30%, 35%, and 37%. This is equivalent to the first effect of defensive [[Hackware]]. A 20% tracing decrease is equivalent to wearing 2 base-tier [[System Shield|System Shields]]. Another effect of destroying a Network Hub is that 3 squads of 3 [[Lightning]] + 1 [[I-47 Archangel|Archangel]] will spawn from different exits and Garrisons. They will patrol around the remaining 3 Network Hubs are located. All non-combat bots will also be called to evacuate the map.\n[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Hub_04(d)[[/Lore]]\n[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]There are 3 variations of the Hub map:\n[[List]]Network Hubs in corners: All 4 Network Hub machines will be in their own corners of the map. They are not likely to overlap in explosion radius and cause chain reactions.|Network Hubs on left side: All 4 Network Hub machines will be on the left side of the map. It is likely that either the top 2 or bottom 2 Hub machines will overlap in explosion radius and guarantee a chain reaction. It is very rarely possible for all 4 Hubs to chain together.|Network hubs on right side: Same as above but on the right side of the map.[[/List]]\n[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]\nBlowing up Network Hubs as soon as you see them is usually a bad idea. Shooting them directly causes a ton of [[Alert]] gain due to their large destructive radius. The Lightning squads that follow can also be very scary for an unprepared Cogmind. If unprepared to fight off the Lightning, it is a good idea to blow up the Hubs from a distance or right next an exit.\nThere are a lot of methods to blow up Network Hubs that do not trigger the alert gain:\n[[List]]Hostile attack: If Cogmind stands in front of a Network Hub and a 0b10 bot misses into it, the destruction will be associated with that bot and not Cogmind. This also works well with allies and drones. Just position the ally in front of a Hub and attacking enemies can shoot around or through them to trigger the explosion.|[[Traps|Trap]] explosion: Traps never assign Alert to Cogmind no matter who is the one who triggers the trap. Any explosive traps will do the trick, and Cogmind can even self-trigger the trap with > without any Alert cost.|Force(Sabotage): If successful, this hack will blow up a random explosive machine on the map. Network Hubs are the only available targets so this will always work on this map. This hack is inconsistent and may fail multiple times in a row. This hack will cause an Alert gain of 50 if successful, but it is substantially less than the several hundred of a manually-blown Network Hub. Note: unlike this hack, Trojan(Detonate) does cause Alert to go up from the Explosion and is not a great hack to use.[[/List]]\nThe best way to deal with the [[Lightning]] squads is to use critical destroy weapons as they lack any critical immunity. [[8R-AWN's Boregun]], [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], and any Hyp. guns or cannons will work well. [[Damper Plating]] works great at reducing damage taken by Lightnings to negligible amounts. The [[Exp. EM Disruption Field]] that they carry can also do fine after being looted.\n[[Heading]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere is only one type of exit on this map.

The center tiles cannot overlap with other lasers and they cannot move through walls, machines, or past the entrance of the Lab. Being within the 3x3 area will result in being scanned immediately. This will cause an announcement [[GameText]]A0_COM: INTRUDER ALERT[[/GameText]] and [[A5]] will show up and fight. This scan will also cause [[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] to appear on most [[0b10]]-controlled floors. The other way to get scanned is to break either the outer wall of Reinforced Barriers or to destroy the Active System Cloaker machine on the right side of the map.

Most players prefer not to transfer to airborne propulsion until [[Factory]] where it is much easier to stealth around and avoid combat. In Materials, it's good to fight enemies one at a time by leading them to one of the many doorways around the map.

These caches contain 3 groups of 4 parts that will be one rating out of depth and can include prototypes. For example, on -9 Materials the standard highest rating part is a 2, while the cache will contain rating 3 or 3* [[Prototype Parts]]. This is one of the best ways to become very strong in Materials.

Aside from the events, the map is sparsely populated with early game patrols of [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. Several types of friendly and occasionally hostile Derelicts can also be found here. [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] and [[Scrap]] can be found randomly on the ground.\n[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Mines[[/Lore]]\n[[Heading]]Prefabs[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Mines Shop Type 1.png|Derelict shop with out-of-depth parts that summons an [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] when opened|Mines Shop Type 2.png|Trapped Derelict shop with [[Imp.

A few Assembled will also show up buried in the walls. Squads of [[T-07 Excavator|Tunnelers]] guarded by [[G-34 Mercenary|Grunts]] will be dispatched continuously every several hundred turns to dig out the collapsed tiles. Using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] is recommended to escape quicker.|(--) Assembled invasion: A large number of Assembled will appear and start attacking everything nearby. An [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] containing 2 [[D-53 Grenadier|Demolishers]] will be dispatched from the closest Materials exit and sent to the initial spawn location. A [[Guerrilla (5)|Derelict]] will appear next to you and tell you to run away as they provide a distraction. This event is extremly dangerous so early in the game as both the Assembled and Demolishers can deal a lot of damage very quickly. A launcher is highly recommended for dealing with the Assembled, while strong single-target weapons like kinetic cannons are ideal for dealing with the Demolishers. Getting stuck between them both is the worst case scenario and stripping to core and running is sometimes the only option to survive. A good tactic to avoid combat is to try to dig into the walls using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] and hide out of sight for a few hundred turns. Usually, most of the Assembled and Demolishers end up destroying each other.[[/List]]",Exits:["Materials","Exiles","Zion"],SpecialBots:["YI-UF0"],SpecialItems:["Bomb Drone Bay","Decoy Drone Bay","Sensor Drone Bay","Splice Drone Bay","Thief Drone Bay","Exp.

The only 2 ways to enter this branch are by using the \\\\IAMDERELICT code at the Recycling exit in Storage or by entering a Storage [[Garrison Machine|Garrisons]] and looping back into this floor instead of proceeding to the next depth. While there are no combat bots on this map, there are very large numbers of [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]] that will scan Cogmind and report an oncoming threat. This adds 15 influence per Spotter, but that is not the real concern. The [[Alert]] on the following map will skyrocket after getting scanned many times and will usually contribute 900 influence. That puts a Cogmind with 0 influence exiting Recycling at alert level 3-N when entering the next map. Because of this, finding a way to purge alert via hacking or exiting into a [[Caves]] branch is highly recommended after visiting Recycling. Recycling is also unique in that is forces a skipped depth. For example, entering a Storage map on -8 leads to a Recycling map on -8 that leads to a [[Factory]] map on -6 rather than -7 like most branches.\nFor all its faults, this map does have some unique benefits. Because there are no combat reinforcements of any kind, there are few downsides to getting traced at all of the [[Terminal|Terminals]] and [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]]. There are a large number of Recycling Machines on this map and using Force(Tunnel) on all of them can be very helpful in uncovering the depths of many maps in the floors above. There are commonly a large number of [[Corrupted Parts|Corrupted]] Authchips]] available for players who want to do a lot of [[Fabricator|Fabrication]].\n[[Heading]]Prefabs[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Recycling Corrupted Authchips.png|Collection of [[Corrupted Parts|Corrupted]] Authchips|Recycling Rewirable Bots.png|Room of broken and disbabled rewirable bots|Recycling Damaged Cache.png|Cache of damaged parts|Recycling Damaged Parts Room.png|Room of damaged parts|Recycling Main Access Exit.png|3 tile wide corridor leading to main access exit[[/Gallery]]\nCompared to many other branches, the Recycling prefabs tend to be very lackluster. The large collection of Authchips is the main unique reward for coming to this branch, although this is not a guaranteed reward. It is possible to ammass a large army of rewired bots, although they all spawn fairly damaged. A large army is also not strongly advised because they will run amok trying to chase after the spotters that run away after being shot at. They also do not help with the Alert issues that are already caused by visiting this map. Other than that, the parts on the ground and in the [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]] tend to be reasonably damaged and low rating and are not very exciting.\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere is only one type of exit in Recycling and it is a main access exit that will always lead to the [[Factory]] map that is 2 floors above the current depth.\n[[Image]]Recycling Warlord Attack.png|Derelicts attacking Recycling[[/Image]]\n[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\nThere is a rare Recycling event where the floor is stormed by white colored friendly but uncontrollable [[Warlord]]-aligned Derelicts.

Research maps continue to amp up the difficulty in strength and number of general combat encounters, hacking difficulty, and difficulty in locating exits. Compared to the previous [[Factory]] floors, Research maps are just as big, but are much more maze-like with large numbers of smaller interconnected rooms and big sections of the level entirely disconnected by large chunks of earth. Exploring all of these different rooms is more difficult than before, and finding an exit can be a real challenge.\nUnlike factory floors with [[Caves]] available, there are usually no easy exits to dissipate [[Alert]] in Research. The natural alert dissipation that occurs between levels continues to decrease. Purging alert or avoiding it in the first place can be a big deal if the player is not prepared to fight off [[High Security]]. [[Infowar]] continues to be important to avoid unnecessary encounters whenever possible, and [[Hackware]] should be used to purge alert and locate exits whenever possible.\nAs the difficulty increases, the rewards do to match. Many powerful unique parts can be found in Research specific branches [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]]. There are also more [[Prototype Parts|Prototypes]] lying around on the floor. Using a [[Component Analysis Suites|Component Analysis Suite]] can pay off to avoid attaching faulty prototypes.\nA big change in Research is the final upgrade of Programmers. The 1-2 [[P-70 Sage|Sages]] per [[Extermination Squad|Extermination]] get upgraded to being 2-3 [[P-80 Master|Masters]]. The extra Programmer on average, higher core integrity, and higher damage output make them a serious threat to prepare for. Many builds will live or die based on how well they can handle Exterminations. Look for a way to kill in a single core shot, like using a [[Enh. Nova Cannon]]. Airborne builds can instead make use of recall hacks or get spotted and run away to avoid direct combat.\nOther important Research level bot upgrades are [[Heavy|Heavies]] and [[Hunter|Hunters]] upgrading to their highest tier on -2. The [[H-81 Overseer]] deals a frightening 91 damage per volley, becomes even tougher to kill, and gains a visual upgrade to 22 tiles which is further than the telltale 20 tile range of the [[Active Sensor Suite]]. The [[H-88 Terminator]] is also a very formidable opponent. The scary changes here are the upgrade from an [[Imp. Phase Shifter]] to an [[Adv. Phase Shifter]] which makes them even more difficult to hit, and the Scan Cloak (4) trait which makes them invisible on [[Sensor Arrays]] unless using an [[Exp. Signal Interpreter]]. If fighting them head on, using [[Launchers]] to aim indirectly or Treads with [[Siege Mode]] can help a lot.\n[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]\n[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Research[[/Lore]]\n[[Heading]]Prefabs[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Research Main Access Exit.png|A 4 tile wide corridor into a main access exit|Research Undefined Exit.png|An unremarkable exit that could lead anywhere|Research Quarantine Exit.png|Unlocked exit to [[Quarantine]]|Research Locked Quarantine Exit.png|Locked exit to [[Quarantine]]|Research Guarded Quarantine Exit.png|Open exit to [[Quarantine]] guarded by a [[B-90 Cyclops]][[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 4 types of main exits on Research floors. Most of them can't be identified via look alone:\n[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Research or [[Access]]. These can sometimes be identifiable by a 4 tile wide corridor that leads into a dead end with the exit in the middle. Otherwise, any non-prefab exit could be a main access exit. [[Signal Interpreters]] or [[Terminal]] access hacks are the main ways to identify these types of exits. There will always be 3 of these exits per map.|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Quarantine]] exit: This is the only other type of exit that can be identified. Quarantine exits can sometimes be identified when they appear as a prefab with several locked or unlocked rows of blast doors. There are also otherwise unremarkable exits that can also lead to Quarantine. These exits will always be on the floor that there are no Testing exits on. There will always be 2 exits on the same depth that Quarantine is on.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Testing]] exit: These exits are always indistinguishable from any other type of exit.

There will only be 1 exit on the depth that Armory is on.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]\nOne other type of additional exit is the [[DSF]]. These exits continue on from Factory and have the same auto-lock on hostile sight behavior. Getting inside is difficult.\n[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[Spoiler:Spoiler]]There are 2 major Research-specific events. Both of these events can only be triggered by previous interactions Cogmind have had in [[Branch|branches]] and have major effects on the maps that they occur on:\n[[Heading:2]]-3 [[Revision 17]] invasion[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Research Revisions.png|Revision 17++ with Revision allies[[/Image]]\n[[Image]]Research Suppression Forces.png|Suppression forces dispatched to fight the Revisions[[/Image]]\nIf Revision 17 is rescued in [[Cetus]] and the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine survives, they will show up in a new form as [[Revision 17++]] and lead a group of 4 [[Revision|Revisions]] to follow Cogmind. They are uncontrollable allies but do not generate any alert for Cogmind when attacking. 200 turns after entering the level, the announcements [[GameText]]Unknown forces entering zones 8R, 1R, 4T. Local Systems Malfunctioning.[[/GameText]] Squads of 4 Revisions will continue to appear from main access exits every 200 turns. Occasionally a Revision will shout [[GameText]]Recycler![[/GameText]] and turn hostile, although this may also be followed by [[GameText]]##MEMORY:RESET##[[/GameText]] to turn them friendly again. 500 turns after Revision 17 arrives, an alert [[GameText]]Research terminal network lockdown[[/GameText]] will appear, and all Terminals on the map will shut down. Another alert will show up 50 turns later: [[GameText]]Suppression forces dispatched. All non-combat units evacuate.[[/GameText]] After this message, squads of 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]] or [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] will start to appear from exits and roam the map, looking for hostiles. They will also spawn every 200 turns.\nThere are a few other side-effects of this event. One is that explosive machines will explode at random whenever Cogmind is nearby. This can be good when fighting enemies around explosive machines, but be wary of them when walking around the map or else they may surprise you at a bad time. Another is that mapgen is affected. [[Heavy|Heavies]] will not appear on a map that Revision 17 invades.\nThis event can be a great blessing or a curse depending on a lot of factors. Getting an escort of alert-free allies with other squads of allies roaming the map is great. They will clean up most of the map for you and can net some free prototype bot loot. Blocking Heavy spawns is incredibly useful here as well. The downsides can also be pretty major, however. Losing access to all Terminals by turn 500 can be very bad if Cogmind is on slow propulsion and has no exit intel and no form of terrain scanning. Trying to  follow the spawning Revisions or suppression forces can lead to an exit, although it can be a bit unreliable. Another downside is that the Revisions will often create a ton of squads to appear right at the beginning of the event. Sometimes, large groups of [[Operator|Operators]] and alarm traps can all be triggered at nearly the same time. This can result in massive groups of hostiles to appear right in Cogmind's face with unlucky exit or garrison positioning.\n[[Heading:2]]-2 [[Warlord]] invasion[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Research Warlord Entrance.png|Warlord making an entrance with friends[[/Image]]\nif Warlord is aligned with in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]], he will bring huge groups of [[Derelict]] forces to attack Research. The event will begin with the alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Engineering response network critical failure, offline[[/GameText]]. More announcements will show up, but the next most important one will be [[GameText]]Warlord currently on norther/central/southern western approach. All unnits hit designated targets[[/GameText]] which indicates where Warlord and [[God Mode]] will appear on the map. 50 turns after entering the map, another announcement [[GameText]]Trap arrays successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will come with all traps being removed from the map. 110 after entering the maps, [[GameText]]Machine network successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will indicate that every machine on the map is now shut down except for [[Garrison Machine|Garrisons]] due to the follow-up message [[GameText]]Unrecognized interference restored garrison access controls. Oops. Just blast them.[[/GameText]] 250 turns after entering the map and every 150 turns after that, 3 different assault squad spawns will appear from garrisons and map exits with the message [[GameText]]Unaware assault squad dispatched in northeast/southeast/southwest/northwest quadrant.[[/GameText]] The spawn location will be indicated on the map. Every 100 turns 1 Derelict squad will spawn on the left side of the map for each tunnel. After 1000 turns on the map, Warlord will tell Cogmind that it is time to retreat and to open the [[Spoiler:Redacted]]Cave Seals in [[Command]] for the final push.[[/Spoiler]]\n[[Image]]Research Warlord Squads.png|A few Derelict squads[[/Image]]\nThe Derelict forces consist of many unique bots during this event. All of them appear as non-controllable allies that do not generate any alert for Cogmind. There are 3 spawn points in the form of giant tunnels. Each tunnel is dug out by a [[Borebot]] escorted by 2 [[Samaritan|Samaritans]]. They will dig straight across the map to the right side. Tiles that are dug out by Borebots are safe to travel on and will not cave-in. Warlord attack squads can vary greatly in composition but are made up of the following bots:\n[[List]][[Butcher (7)|Butchers]]|[[Commander|Commanders]]|[[Dragon|Dragons]]|[[Fireman (7)|Firemen]]|[[Guerrilla (7)|Guerrillas]]|[[Hydra|Hydras]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)|Marauders]]|[[Martyr (7)|Martyrs]]|[[Savage (7)|Savages]]|[[Thug (7)|Thugs]]|[[Troll|Trolls]]|[[Wasp (7)|Wasps]]|[[Wizard (7)|Wizards]][[/List]]\n[[Image]]Research Warlord Assault Squads.png|0b10 Warlord response assault squad[[/Image]]The 0b10 forces come in groups of 3 bots. There are always 2 (not necessarily of the same type) of [[Executioner]], [[Striker]], and [[D-83 Annihilator]] bots along with a [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] full of bots. They roam around the map looking for bots to fight.\nThis event tends to be great for Cogmind. The primary downsides is that the machine network turns off relatively early into the event and locating the desired exit can be a pain. Getting stuck in a bad position without any Derelict allies can also be painful since the assaults, particularly the prototype bots and demolishers, pack quite a punch. However, the large number of alert-free allies and free loot from the bots fighting is great to any build. Like the Revision 17 event, this event will also cause the maps to have no Heavies. Finding any exit is usually possible by following the assault dispatch notifications. Assaults will be dispatched out of any Garrison or exit. The only exits that assaults do not come from are Quarantine prefab exits. In that case, using other infowar like terrain scanning and drones is the best way to locate these exits.[[/Spoiler]]",Exits:["DSF","Garrison","Testing","Quarantine","Access"],SpecialBots:["Borebot","Commander","Dragon","Executioner","Hydra","Knight","Revision","Revision 17++","Striker","Troll","Warlord"],MinDepth:-3,MaxDepth:-2},{Name:"Scrapyard",ImageName:"Scrapyard.png",Content:"The starting point of every game.

There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. There are also powerful special and unique items that are not obtainable anywhere else. Even among normal parts, there is a much higher than usual chance of finding [[Prototype Parts]] on the ground.\nTesting is home to the [[SGEMP Prototype]] that [[Zhirov]] asks for when you see him in his [[Zhirov (Location)|lab]]. It is guarded by 2 [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[Alpha 7]]. The SGEMP always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the SGEMP would be in the bottom left. With the [[Phasing AFG]] and [[Portable AFG]], it is possible to retrieve the SGEMP without getting spotted at all. Otherwise the primary methods of obtaining are fighting the bots head-on or grabbing it and making a run for it.\n[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]\nAttacking when in visual range of a Researcher or attacking a Researcher will result in them turning yellow and attempting to stasis and scan any hostiles.

If Cogmind is scanned, it will also result in [[Q-Series]] being summoned instead of [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. These Q-Series have custom loadout that depends on Cogmind's current build.\nTypically getting scanned is seen as a negative due to the high power level of Q-Series. Some builds might intentionally want to get scanned in order to get the Q-Series loot. To avoid unintentionally scanning, detach any ranged weapons whenever a Researcher is in line of sight of Cogmind.

They can spawn in one of 4 states: Unpowered, Dormant, Active, or Disabled/rewirable. Protovariants can be of the following types:\n[[List]][[Protovariant D]]: Demolisher|[[Protovariant G]]: Grunt|[[Protovariant H]]: Hunter|[[Protovariant L]] Duelist|[[Protovariant P]]: Programmer|[[Protovariant X]]: Specialist|[[Protovariant Y]]: Sentry[[/List]]\nIn Testing there is a special hack that can appear on [[Terminal|Terminals]]: [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]]. If successfully performed, it will turn a Protovariant on the map hostile to everything. The Protovariant can make quite a mess of 0b10 bots, but may cause more trouble than it's worth. Researchers will report the bot repeatedly when they see it attack. Additionally, there is a special assault [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] that gets dispatched to the Protovariant's location. This ARC contains an [[Investigator]] inside that will scan Cogmind even without being provoked.\n[[Heading:2]]Testing Shells[[/Heading]]\nThe majority of unique Testing items appear in Reinforced Shells. There are no identifying features that indicate the contents of these Shells. The list of unique Testing items contained within are:\n[[List]][[2N-1CE's Frost Array]]|[[AEGIS Remote Shield]]|[[Cld.

One prefab has 1-2 [[Potential Cannon|Potential Cannons]] or [[Imp. Potential Cannon|Imp. Potential Cannons]] (not necessarily the same type) and several [[Imp. Energy Well|Imp]], [[Adv. Energy Well|Adv]], or [[Exp. Energy Well|Exp. Energy Wells]]. The other shell is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors and has a special Researcher behind. The Terminal can be hacked to open the doors, but the Researcher will make it difficult to break the Shell without getting scanned. However, penetrating the heavy doors first will allow safely killing the Researcher. It is also possible to dig in to the back of the prefab directly into the Shell area. The shell will always contain [[SHELL Armor]] and 3 random pieces of [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]], [[Med. Regenerative Plating]], or [[Hvy. Regenerative Plating]]. The Terminal on the inside of the shell contains schematic for some of the regenerative platings.\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere is always 1, and possibly 2 exits in Testing:\n[[List]]Main access exit: There will always be 1 exit that leads to the next main Research or [[Access]] floor.

This map is home to a large number of [[Derelict|Derelicts]] allied with Warlord and ready to fight. This branch is much more combat-oriented than many of the other Caves branches, with large waves of [[0b10]] bots assaulting the base. Initially the map is totally safe and filled with friendly NPCs, but after one of several conditions is met a large assault will begin.\nThe right side of the map is the same every run. There is a small cave-like area with an exit just above the starting area. There are a few [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] spread around this section of the map, so be prepared if Cogmind has any [[Corruption]]. There are two entrances into the base: The first has some doors blocking a large corruption-cleansing System Quarantine Field Array, some opened Blast Doors, and a second set of regular doors opening up into 2 [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. This entrance has a large number of [[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] installed. The second way in is either on the top or the bottom of the map, hidden behind some fake walls. These will automatically open if approached from the inside of the base. Behind these fake walls are a set of Sealed Heavy Doors, followed by one more set of fake walls. If Cogmind is [[RIF]] aligned, they will be detected and the entire base will be turned hostile. This occurs no matter which entrance is taken. It is safe to get the corruption cleanse, but any further will be dangerous.\nThe interior of the base is different every run. There are always 2 guaranteed rooms in every run. The first is the Vortex Lab which is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors with a [[Terminal]] to open it next to them. Inside are some [[Tinkerer|Tinkerers]], a lore Terminal, and a random assortment of Vortex weaponry. There will always be at least one pair of weapons from the following list:\n[[List]][[Vortex Cannon]]|[[Vortex Driver]]|[[Vortex Lance]]|[[Vortex Rail]]|[[Vortex Rifle]]|[[Vortex Shotgun]][[/List]]\nThere may also be a single [[Vortex Catalyst Activator]], and if this is a seed where the [[Exiles]] abandoned their hideout, [[EX-BIN]] will be present along with a [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]]. The other guaranteed room is Warlord's throne room. In it are Warlord himself, 6 [[Thug (7)|Thugs]], 2 [[Knight|Knights]], [[God Mode (Fake)|Fake God Mode]], and Warlord's stash. The stash is locked by Sealed Heavy Doors. The Terminal can be hacked open with a special code obtained at a Terminal in [[Data Miner (Location)]].\nThe contents of Warlord's stash will vary every game with only the Vortex Chain Reactor being guaranteed.

These bots roam around the map randomly in groups, but usually come straight through the main entrance. When this happens, a large group of [[Bouncer|Bouncers]] will join the existing Marauder guards at the front gate. The first wave will usually be decimated by the entryway traps, but many more will follow.\nThere are a total of 14 assault waves, although it is highly recommended to leave the map before that many enemy bots appear. 10 turns after the first [[GameText]]MAIN.C incursion imminent. Mobilizing sentries[[/GameText]] announcement, the first wave will appear with the announcement [[GameText]]Northeast/Southeast/Central east cave walls breached[[/GameText]] indicating where the spawn location is. From then on, waves will spawn in 100 turn increments. Every 90 turns will give a [[GameText]]MAIN.C reinforcements approaching through caves, arriving soon[[/GameText]] announcement, and 10 turns after that the waves will spawn with an announcement of the wave composition. 4 squads can spawn per wave.\n[[Image]]Warlord Assault Wave.png|A typical assault wave. Pictured are Saboteur, Hunter, Melee, and Grunt squads with Prototype support[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:2]]Assault Contents[[/Heading]]\nThe hostile forces are made up of different types of squads, each with their own squad leader:\n[[List]]Behemoth Squad: [[Behemoth|Behemoths]]|Demolisher Squad: [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] with a [[Protector]]|Grunt Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], sometimes with a [[Specialist]] squad leader or [[Protector]] support|Hunter Squad: [[Hunter|Hunters]] and [[Swarmer|Swarmers]]|Melee Squad: [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]] with a [[Protector]]|Mixed Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]], and [[Mechanic|Mechanics]]|Programmer Squad: [[Programmer|Programmers]]|Saboteur Squad: [[E-15 Imp|Imps]] and [[Grunt|Grunts]]|Swarmer Squad: [[Swarmer|Swarmers]][[/List]]\nSometimes these squads can spawn with \"Prototype Support\". When this happens, [[Executioner]] and [[Striker]] bots can also appear as part of a squad.\n[[Heading:2]]Assisting[[/Heading]]Destroying the doors in the entryway can be a good idea to allow the Bouncers and Marauders to pick hostiles off one-by-one as they enter visual range. This is ideally done before triggering the assault in the first place. Melee weapons are a safe way to do this, otherwise you may run the risk of missing into a friendly Derelict that will become not-so-friendly in a hurry.\n[[Image]]Warlord Wall Lure.png|Luring hostiles around the wall[[/Image]]Staying and fighting near the main entryway is one of the best approaches to fighting the waves off. Join in with [[Launchers]] if you have them, but make sure to watch out for friendly fire. There is a bit of leeway, but hitting allies too many times will be considered a betrayal. Demolishers and Programmers are the highest priority targets since they can cause a lot of damage with Launchers and robot hacking respectively. Throwing Claymores and the Vortex Catalyst Activator that can both be obtained on this map are great options to destroy waves with ease. [[Visual Processing Units]] coupled with long ranged weapons are another good option to sit back and snipe bots from outside their typical range. The entrance defense is quite strong and will perform well most of the time. However, a squad of Programmers with an unlucky chain-assimilation of bots or some unchecked Demolishers will quickly tear any defense to pieces.\nEven a build with little offensive power can help out in this part of the defense. Getting spotted first will cause hostiles to prioritize Cogmind for a while, even if they are getting shot by something else. This means that the Warlord bots can blast away all the hostiles while they are trying to run after you. This can work well for combat builds too, especially for combat bots without launchers of their own.\n[[Heading:2]]Counterattack[[/Heading]]\nIn between the 4th and 5th waves, a Derelict will appear next to Cogmind to leave the base with the counterattack for cover. At this point, the majority of the combat Derelicts except for the guard Marauders and Bouncers will begin to head outside of the base. The strength of the counterattacks depends on a lot of factors. If the defense falters early on, the counterattack can get caught up fighting a bunch of squads and never make it out the entrance. Their tendency to trickle to the fight can be a big weakness if the hostiles are bunched up and can quickly take out Derelicts one at a time. On the other hand, [[Sapper|Sappers]] will dramatically increase the strength of any counterattack and can destroy big groups of bots on their own. \nThe counterattack is usually a good time to exit the map whether it's successful or not. For airborne builds especially, even if the counterattack dies early on it can serve as a good distraction as you fly by.\n[[Heading:2]]Base Infiltration[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]Warlord Enhanced Allies.png|Enhanced Allies[[/Image]]In between the 7th and 8th assault waves is the final event of the map. A random spot in the Warlord base will be infiltrated and hostile assault squads will begin to appear from that location too with the announcement [[GameText]]Base interior infiltrated, regroup at designated outer cave rendezvous points[[/GameText]]. At the same time, a friendly group of 3 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] and 3 [[Enhanced Demolisher|Enhanced Demolishers]] will teleport into Warlord's throne room to assist. 2 of the Demolishers will immediately head toward the exit while the remaining bots follow Warlord around. At this point, all surviving Derelicts will head toward Warlord as he makes his way over to the map exit.\nThis is the last chance to exit the map with any amount of assistance. With assaults pouring in from the main entrance and a spot in the base itself, it is time to go. The Enhanced Demolishers have incredible loot including [[Cmb. Linear Gravjet|Cmb. Linear Gravjets]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]], [[Coolant Network]], and the unique [[Chain Missile Launcher]]. While attacking these bots too much will anger Warlord, sneaking a few [[Plasma Cutter]] hits may be worth the risk for the big rewards.",Exits:["Proximity Caves"],SpecialBots:["Bouncer","Enhanced Demolisher","Enhanced Grunt","EX-BIN","Executioner","God Mode (Fake)","Knight","Striker","Warlord"],SpecialItems:["BFG-9k Vortex Edition","Ghost Barrier","Mak.

Cogmind will get dropped in instantly, and any nearby allies or bots who have previously triggered a chute trap will also appear over time. Wastes can be a very brutal map for an unprepared player. There are 6 hostile [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] that can decimate Cogmind's build in a few hits. There is an EMP that is on in some Wastes maps that fires every 100 turns and adds between 5 to 10% [[Corruption]] to Cogmind. This corruption can be reduced by EM [[Resistance Devices]] and [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]]. There are various broken, faulty, or otherwise low integrity parts scattered on the ground. These parts can be several ratings out of depth and can be good to try to repair or scan and fabricate.\nThe layout of this map is semi-fixed. The entrance, exits, and general layouts of the map are similar, although the exact layout can vary a bit in which way paths are connected. There are wide 4 tile corridors that sometimes have 8 by 8 tile wide dead ends on the far ends of the map.

Either try to search the big map endings where the Derelict allies spawn from or make a beeline for the exit on the right of the map. The Derelicts will usually take out most of the Crushres without any assistance.If trying to fly by, the Crushers do not have the most intelligent movement and can often be juked by luring them to one side of a corridor and then crossing by the other side out of reach. Circling back may be needed to avoid groups of Crushers. If the EMP is off, Cogmind might be able to kite the Crushers indefinitely in order to shoot them to death with any ranged weapon.

This is a safe map with no hostile spawns and only friendly bots, although Cogmind should be wary of [[Corruption]] triggering misfires that anger Zhirov. Detaching all ranged weapons is advised.\nThis map initially appears to be a small section of caves with only an exit. Approaching the left wall will cause the cave walls to slide away to reveal some Cloak Generators and some larger Sealed Heavy Doors blocking the way. These Cloak Generators surround the entire outside of Zhirov's lab. Continuing to the left will cause the doors to slide down and reveal Zhirov himself who will greet you. [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] guard just above and below the entrance on the left side.\nThere are a large collection of [[Terminal|Terminals]] to the left of Zhirov. The first terminal going counterclockwise contains some lore records and the depths of, [[Quarantine]], [[Testing]], and [[Command]]. The second contains Analyses for [[Q-Series]], [[Striker|Strikers]], [[Executioner|Executioners]], and [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]]. The third contains 4 Prototype ID Banks. The fourth contains Schematics for an [[Assault Drone Bay]], [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Exp. Optical Array]], and [[Imp. Arc Thrower]]. This is the only way that Assault Drone Bays can be obtained. In the room just below this, there is a series of 3 Terminals that describe Zhirov's past since arriving on Tau Ceti IV.\nNear the center area there are two [[Alien Artifact|Alien Artifacts]] with explanatory Terminals.

If destroyed, there are some major consequences that follow. Zhirov and friends will immediately turn aggressive and begin to attack. A large group of friendly [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] wil teleport in and start attacking Zhirov. Zhirov will attempt to teleport out when his core integrity gets to about half. He will first say [[GameText]]Looks like we have to say goodbye to this place, and you[[/GameText]]. This will rig a large number of explosions to go off in about 10 turns. This happens even if the Cloak Generators are already intact and Zhirov is attacked.\n[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]][[Image]]Testing SGEMP.png|The SGEMP room in Testing[[/Image]]\nAfter entering and exiting the Terminal room, Zhirov will ask Cogmind to steal the [[SGEMP Prototype]] from Testing and bring it to [[Access]]. If done, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up in Access and will give Cogmind perfect map intel. They will follow Cogmind for a while, although they will all teleport out when Zhirov falls below roughly half core integrity. If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used prior to Access but Cogmind still carries the SGEMP, Zhirov and his allies will turn hostile and fight Cogmind to the death. There are no other Alignment incompatabilities with this quest.\nThere is a second part of this quest that continues in [[Command]]. [[Spoiler:Redacted]]After destroying the first form of [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]] in Command, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up and attack MAIN.C. Zhirov will activate the Modified SGEMP and disable all 0b10-aligned bots on the map. This also affects [[Warlord (Command)]], but no other Derelicts.[[/Spoiler]]\n[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]\nFighting Zhirov and gaining anything from the encounter is not an easy task. Although he has some nice loot, his tendency to teleport out at the slightest hint of danger and explosive aftermath even on a successful kill is very frustrating to deal with. One option is to loot Perun and Svarog while ignoring Zhirov and simply exiting the map safely. These 2 can still have some good parts, although they have nothing as lucrative as Zhirov with the guaranteed inventory drops of [[Deep Network Scanner]], [[Quantum Router]], and a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]]. Only Zhirov can set off the traps and cause the group to leave.\nThe best way to safely grab all the loot is with [[Master Tearclaws]] that can be looted from [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]]. These Tearclaws can strip all 3 bots of their parts with little risk of explosives. Just make sure Zhirov doesn't fall below 80 core integrity. The Tearclaws can even remove the inventory items without requiring Zhirov to actually be killed. The idea is to shoot one of the bots from just outside of one of the rooms and then retreat behind one of the doorways. This will let you safely use the melee Tearclaws while only getting attacked by 1 bot at a time.",Exits:["Proximity Caves"],SpecialBots:["Perun","Svarog","Zhirov"],SpecialItems:["Integrated Reactor","Integrated Dissipator","Transdimensional Reconstructor"],MinDepth:-5,MaxDepth:-4,Branch:!0,Spoiler:"Spoiler"},{Name:"Zion",ImageName:"Zion.png",Content:'Zion is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -7 or -6 and is the home to a large number of [[Derelict]] [[Zionite|Zionites]].

Similar to Caves, [[Scrap]] and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can appear on the ground here. Aside from one relatively harmless event, there are no hostile bots that appear on this map unless Cogmind attacks or attempts to enter while aligned with [[RIF]]. The System Quarantine Field Array at the entrance of the map will cleanse all [[Corruption]]. It is strongly recommended to detach any ranged weapons until cleansing corruption to avoid any misfires that will turn the map hostile. RIF-aligned bots can only go as far as triggering the cleanse, any further will turn Zion hostile.\nZion maps are randomly generated but will always have the same overall appearance. There is a small Caves-like section on the east containing the spawn point and exit to Proximity Caves. To the left is the Quarantine Array machine guarded by 2 friendly [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. The bulk of Zion is contained within a large hollow square shape. All of the unique prefabs are contained within this area of the map. To the top left is the locked entrance to the [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Below that is a [[Tinkerer]] next to the Conduit Teleporter, 4 [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]], the [[Imprinter]], and some more Tinkerers next to the Imprinting Machine.\n[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]Walking into the Imprinting machine will allow Cogmind to [[Imprint]] which has some major gameplay effects. The main change is that Cogmind can no longer use normal hacks at [[Terminal|Terminals]] and can now only use a specific set of randomized Zionite hacks. The 4 Mutants that guard the Imprinter will also turn purple and begin to follow you. There is an additional unique effect in [[Command]]: [[Spoiler:Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, powerful Zionite bots will pop out along with various other Zionite-aligned Derelicts.

The majority of the [[Zionite|Zionites]] are initially unarmed, although they can scavenge through the Twisted Machinery tiles in order to find several (usually weak) types of guns or melee weapons. Zionites will also appear out of the machinery tiles and instantly attack. This will only happen if Cogmind is within a few tiles of some machinery, so using explosive weaponry on these tiles is highly recommended to avoid unnecessarily fighting extra bots. It is very tedious but possible to use melee to destroy many of these tiles before triggering hostilities to avoid sneak attack possibilities.\nOne of the largest benefits and threats to fighting Zion is the [[Z-Hero]] spawn. There is a chance that a hostile Hero will spawn at the Caves exit and roam around the map. It is important to have a plan to deal with some of the stronger Heroes like [[99-TNT]] and [[P1-3CE]], even if that plan is only to spot them first and run to avoid getting spotted in return. Other heroes like [[ME-RLN]] are easier to kill. All of them can provide incredibly strong unique loot. Another big reason to fight is the [[Imprinter Data Core]] that will guarantee access to the [[Zion Deep Caves]] if no other methods are available.\n[[Heading]]Prefabs[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]Zion Cloak Generator.png|A Cloak Generator machine (they don\'t do anything)|Zion Visual Enhancement Terminal.png|Bot with a "Visual Enhancement" hack|Zion Visual Enhancement Hack.gif|Effect of using previous "Visual Enhancement" hack|Zion Butterfly Terminal.png|Derelict talking about "Symbols and butterflies" with Terminal hack|Zion Butterfly Hack.png|Effect of using previous "Symbols and butterflies" hack|Zion Broken Bots.png|A Derelict analyzing broken [[0b10]] bots|Zion Broken Bots 2.png|More broken bots with various parts strewn around|Zion Decoder Chips.png|Stash of [[0b10 Decoder Chips]]|Zion Warlord Parts Stash.png|Stash of Warlord Derelict parts|Zion Mak Stash.png|Stash of Makshift parts|Zion Launcher Cache.png|Derelict with stash of [[Launchers]]|Zion Programmer Couplers.png|Derelict with stash of [[Relay Coupler [Programmer]|Programmer Couplers]]|Zion Processor Stash.png|Derelict with stash of Processors|Zion Authchip Stash.png|Derelict with stash of [[Authchips]]|Zion SDI Derelict.png|Derelict that gives [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]]|Zion Hacking Drone Bay.png|Derelict that gives a [[Hacking Drone Bay]]|Zion Craig With Stick.png|CR-A16 who gives their [[CR-A16\'s Pointy Stick|Pointy Stick]]|Zion Deep Caves Code.png|Derelict that gives the codes to the Deep Caves Terminals|Zion Mobile Refinery.png|Derelict that has created the [[Mobile Refinery Mk.

A few are useless, some are more niche, but most are going to have a use in many builds. Every game has a half dozen or so of these encounters available and it is likely that most builds will get something nice out of the trip.\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere are 2 types of exits in Zion:[[List]][[Proximity Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top right side of the map near where Cogmind spawns.|[[Zion Deep Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top left side of the map protected by locked blast doors. The doors can be unlocked with a random Derelict event that will provide the hacking codes, unlocked with the hacking codes by obtaining the [[Imprinter Data Core]], or broken into with an Impact or overloadable Thermal cannon like a [[Cld. Particle Cannon]]. The Reinforced Barriers have an armor value of 56 while the Sealed Blast Doors have an armor value of 45 with 0% thermal resistance.[[/List]][[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]\n[[List]](+/-) [[Hunter]] attack: A Hunter disguised as a Derelict will sneak up to the gates of Zion and attack the Marauder guards. This will usually result in the quarantine array being destroyed and the Hunter losing the fight. The dropped parts can be collected by Cogmind but will quickly self-destruct.[[/List]]',Exits:["Proximity Caves","Zion Deep Caves"],SpecialBots:["Imprinter"],SpecialItems:["Bomb Factory No. 2","CR-A16's Pointy Stick","GAL Module","Hacking Drone Bay","Mobile Refinery Mk. CCLXVII","Phasing AFG","Relay Coupler [Programmer]","RU-N14's Throwing Claymores","Storm Laser"],MinDepth:-7,MaxDepth:-6,Branch:!0,Spoiler:"Spoiler"},{Name:"Zion Deep Caves",ImageName:"Zion Deep Caves.png",Content:"The Zion Deep Caves is a [[Branch]] off of [[Zion]] that seems to serve as a sort of base of operations for the [[Imprinter]] and the Zionites. This is a very combat oriented map that requires a lot of preparation to complete entirely. It is possible for a very fast flight build to sneak in, grab one or two things, and escape, but the presence of the prefect-tracking 24 speed [[Z-Imprinter]] makes things tough.\nThe bulk of the map has a predefined layout except for the right starting point and middle-left exit area which are slightly different every time. These two random areas are mostly empty but can contain small groups of [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] and a disabled [[Surveybot 24]]. To the left of the starting area are a big Z-Facility machine, a huge explosive Z-Power, and some [[Z-Technician|Z-Technicians]] working on the machine. Above and below are [[Z-Light (5)|Z-Light]] guards. On the top and left side there are Zionite item stashes. To the left side of the exit area is a collection of assorted broken Derelict bots and highly damaged parts. There is an [[Exiles]] item near the top of the area. The far left is an Impregnable Wall which contains a large amount of Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]]. The wall is guarded by a [[Golem]] above and below. There are also some Wall Chambers that drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. The units will start regrowing into hostile Golems.\nWhile quite challenging, there are some very strong unique rewards on this map. GOLEM units are only available here and can provide a strong build in a-box. [[Asb. Focal Cannon|Focal Cannons]] will tear through most anything in the game quite easily. The [[Asb. Combat Suite]] is a unique part that combines [[Phase Shifters]], [[Targeting Computers]], and [[Core Analyzers]] in a single slot. The [[Surveybot 24 Chip]] is the strongest type of [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scan Processor]] in the game. [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] can protect late-game super-weapons from harm. The [[Zio. Biocell]] is an early way to gain a mostly identical [[Exp. Energy Well]] early in the game.\n[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]\nThere are some key requirements to deal with each section of this map and common approaches for dealing with each. Here is a general checklist of things that will be useful throughout the map:\n[[List]]Propulsion/Weapon/Armor + backups: You will do a lot of fighting in this map. Having backups of these more important parts will keep you alive.|[[Launchers]]: These can be used for the Z-Imprinter, Z-Lights, and especially for the Assembled in the wall. Multiple backups are recommended.|EM weapons: EM is the only effective way to fight Golems. EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge]] or [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bombs]] can also be used but having at least 1 EM weapon is best to be safe.|(Optional) [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]]: Completely neutralizes the threat of the Assembled wall.|(Optional) Allies: Makes the opening Z-Imprinter fight much easier to handle.|(Optional) Dead [[Imprinter]]: Killing the Imprinter in Zion prevents her from showing up in this map. She has no weapons in Zion so taking her out there can be a easy way to skip a big threat on this map.[[/List]]\n[[Heading:2]]Starting Area[[/Heading:2]]\nThere isn't much threat here. There can be groups of 3 Assembled that can be easily dispatched by any weapons, although Launchers are most effective.\n[[Image]]ZDC Allies.png|Fighting the Z-Imprinter with allies[[/Image]][[Image]]ZDC Imprinter Launcher.png|Aiming past the Imprinter with a Launcher[[/Image]]\n[[Heading:2]][[Z-Imprinter]][[/Heading:2]]\nAfter entering the main open area of the map, the Z-Imprinter will spawn and head directly to Cogmind's location. 2 Z-Lights will follow the Imprinter but are much slower and will take some time to arrive. The Z-Imprinter has high evasion, 150 core integrity, and deals a large amount of damage every volley. Allies are highly recommended for this fight to help destroy her quicker and to draw fire from you. The Derelict ally events from Zion can help, as can the A8 code [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. Use the code on any of the gate terminals on the entrance to this map. A [[Tactical Coordination Suite]] can really help out with a ally damage. [[Targeting Computers]] or 2-slot Treads with [[Siege Mode]] are also recommended to be able to hit the Imprinter more frequently.\nFor Cogmind's build, any non-EM and non-Impact damage types will work. To get the [[Zio. Metafield Generator]], +Salvage is recommended by using guns with the best available type of [[Salvage Targeting Computers|Salvage Targeting Computer]]. Although it doesn't deal much damage, EM can be used to apply +Salvage if allies are providing enough damage output otherwise. If salvage isn't needed, using Explosive Launchers will be very effective here. Rather than aiming directly at the Imprinter, aim the launcher at a wall or at the end of its range so that the Imprinter is still hit close to the source. This will maintain a high accuracy while still dealing the bulk of the damage to the Imprinter. This technique can also be used against the Z-Lights to good effect.\nAfter the Z-Imprinter is dead, take care that your allies don't spot the Z-Technicians by the Z-Power machine. They will almost assuredly miss into the machine and end up nuking themselves, and if you're not careful, Cogmind. Beware its large 15 tile radius.\n[[Heading:2]][[Z-Light]] Guards[[/Heading]]The top and bottom of the map have groups of 3 Z-Light guards. There are 2 groups on the top and one on the bottom. All of these are optional encounters. To avoid them, dig through the center of the Z-Facility and hang near the left side of the area. Enter the tunnel near the top side to avoid getting spotted by the bottom group. The top Z-Lights are often worth fighting because of the large number of special Zionite parts they guard. It is possible to reach the first alcove on the top without getting spotted, but the remainder are all guarded\nIf Cogmind still has strong allies like Enhanced Grunts alive from the Z-Light encounter, it is possible to just charge in and fight them all at once. They are not as dangerous as the Z-Imprinter, but in large numbers they can still pack a punch. Using Launchers is very effective on these bots since they don't tend to be very tanky as long as you can actually hit them. Using a [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to lure them 1 at a time can also be an effective strategy if fighting with non-launcher weapons to preserve salvage.\n[[Heading:2]]Exit Area[[/Heading]]\nSame as the starting area, the only threat here is small groups of 3 Assembled.\n[[Heading:2]][[Golem|Golems]][[/Heading]]\nGolems are incredibly tanky enemies with an extreme damage output and the source of many lost runs. In order to claim a GOLEM Unit or the exiles item, Cogmind must fight or at least run past them. Conventional weapons do not work at all here. With a 10% core exposure, 200 core integrity, and 15% damage resistance to non-melee damage types, trying to fight fairly is suicide. The best approach is EM damage or Impact. Golems only require an average of 118 damage to corrupt them to death compared to thousands of damage with non-EM weapons. Using [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] looted earlier may be helpful here to avoid losing your only way to fight.\nDue to uneven calculations for line-of-sight and weapon range, it is possible to shoot the Golems once before you are spotted at 16 range. See the Golem 1/2 spots below for reference. This allows Cogmind to wait 2 turns before shooting to avoid any movement accuracy penalties, since every time counts particularly hard when fighting a Golem. If using EM traps, short ranged EM weapons, or Impact weapons, see the lure images for reference. This will get Cogmind spotted, likely get shot at for 1 volley, and then draw the Golem in closer. The Exiles item will typically require fighting the top Golem. The bottom one tends to be totally optional.\n[[Gallery]]ZDC Golem Spot 1.png|16-range Golem 1 spot|ZDC Golem Spot 2.png|Golem 2 spot|ZDC Golem Lure 1.png|Golem lure 1|ZDC Golem Lure 2.png|Golem lure 2[[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]][[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] Wall[[/Heading]]\n[[Image]]ZDC Wall Activation Zone.png|Approximate wall activation zone[[/Image]]\nThe Assembled wall is an indestructible wall containing 35 Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]] that will automatically open up when Cogmind gets too close to it. See the image on the right for a range reference. This range encompasses the GOLEM Unit containers, so fighting the wall is required to grab them the normal way.\nFighting the wall practically requires Launchers to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Any kinds of launchers work, although explosive launchers are better due to their higher range and base damage. Trying to use launchers at a range where they won't miss and take out the GOLEM unit containers is ideal. Otherwise it can be minorly annoying up to even deadly to have a large number of growing Golems running around. They grow slowly, but trying to deal with the Assembled and growing Golems at the same time can be a recipe for disaster. Alternately, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] can be used here to almost entirely eliminate any threat of the wall. The Assemblers will still need to be destroyed, but the rest of the Assembled will become useless.\n[[Heading:2]]Loot[[/Heading]]\nAfter everything else is cleaned out, all that's left is claiming the loot. Wall Chambers will drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. They will turn into a Golem almost immediately, so grab them quickly. They can sometimes be turned into their part state upon being destroyed (standard loot rules), so applying positive and negative Salvage does work here. Using melee weapons is recommended to avoid missing into other containers and spawning further Golems.\nOne alternative method of claiming the GOLEM Units can avoid fighting the wall at all. The idea is to shoot open some of the Golem chambers, purposefully allow them to regrow a leg, let them wander closer to the right side of the map, and then destroy them a +Salvage method to obtain a GOLEM Unit. This method can be a bit risky if the regrowing Golems do not cooperate and will result in damaged GOLEM Units. This approach can be particularly useful if Cogmind is stuck without any Launchers but still wants to play a Golem build.\nThe Exiles item will normally require fighting both the wall and the top Golem. One alternative is if Zion contained the [[Phasing AFG]]. By using that, the item can be grabbed without any fighting on the left side of the map.\n[[Heading]]Prefabs[[/Heading]]\n[[Gallery]]ZDC Assembled Flower.png|A small group of Assembled|ZDC Surveybot.png|[[Surveybot 24]]|ZDC Exit.png|Exit to Caves[[/Gallery]]\n[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]\nThere is only one type of exit in Zion Deep Caves.

Unsure of its purpose, so far I've simply replicated it at the molecular level and continued testing.

The Sigix have no apparent way to reproduce, suggesting they may rely purely on genetic engineering and artificial methods of reproduction.

Future efforts to completely clear and protect the Proximity Caves will require a more versatile heavy attacker capable of quickly burrowing through rock. To that end, Superbehemoth frames are embedded with a weaker version of the Sigix Matter Drive, while also carrying enough different weaponry to deal with a variety of threats without supporting units."},{"Name/Number":"Tracker",Content:"Trackers are still new designs that may need more updates, but will no doubt become vital in the effort to protect my most important assets. Their built-in drive enables them to catch up to anything ever spotted coming out of the caves so far, and although they're equipped with valuable technology themselves, rather than harden them with armor and slow them down, Trackers have improved evasive capabilities to help avoid getting hit in the first place. The combination of rapid-fire Linked Autogun and Immobilizer for slowing fast targets will make Derelicts think twice before raiding upper 0b10 for spare parts."}]};
