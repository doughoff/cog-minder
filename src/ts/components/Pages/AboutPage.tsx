                Cog-Minder is a helper website for <a href="https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/">Cogmind</a>. It has
                a <a href="parts.html">parts searcher</a> that takes information from the in-game gallery CSV export and
                turns it into this searchable webpage, a <a href="bots.html">bots bestiary</a> that lists all bots in
                the game and their stats, a <a href="build.html">build planner</a> that allows for creating a build
                loadout and viewing stats for it, a <a href="combat.html">combat log analyzer</a>, a{" "}
                <a href="hacks.html">hacking calculator</a> that shows hacking success rates, a{" "}
