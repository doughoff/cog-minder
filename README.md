# About

Cog-Minder is a helper website for [Cogmind](https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/). It has a [parts searcher](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/parts.html) that takes information from the in-game gallery CSV export and turns it into this searchable webpage, a [bots bestiary](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/bots.html) that lists all bots in the game and their stats, a [build planner](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/bots.html) that allows for creating a build loadout and viewing stats for it, a [combat log analyzer](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/combat.html), a [hacking calculator](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/hacks.html) that shows hacking success rates, a [combat simulator](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/simulator.html) that predicts combat outcomes from a collection of equipped parts, a [RIF reference](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/rif.html) for RIF abilities and bot hacking, and an unofficial [wiki](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/wiki.html). It should have all items and bots as of Beta 13, let me know if anything seems missing. Check it out [here](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/).

This is an MIT licensed open source project with the source available on GitHub.

Thanks to Valguris, PI-314, GJ, ZXC, MTF, and Captain Croissandwich from the roguelike discord for donating early gallery exports, PlasticHeart for creating the [Cog and Smallcaps](https://github.com/plhx/cogfont) font files, and Kyzrati for making Cogmind.
